# ABSTRACT

This study evaluates the implications of different minimun legal harvest size on the population dynamics and management outcomes of the wedge clam (*Donax trunculus*) fishery in the Gulf of Cádiz. Using an integrated length-to-age stock assessment model implemented in Stock Synthesis, we analyze four selectivity scenarios based on minimum legal sizes: 26, 25 (current regulation), 24 and 23 mm. The objective is to assess how variations in legal size thresholds affect estimates of recruitment, total biomass, and spawning stock biomass, and to determine the potential consequences for the sustainability of the fishery.

Each scenario is modeled under consistent structural assumptions and data inputs, allowing for meaningful comparison across population metrics. Model inputs are derived from a robust, ongoing monitoring program for *D. trunculus*, which includes monthly data on population structure, fishery effort and landings, and environmental variables. This comprehensive dataset strengthens the model’s ability to reflect realistic biological and fishery conditions.

Preliminary results indicate that decreasing the minimum legal size leads to a marked reduction in spawning biomass and alters recruitment dynamics, potentially increasing the risk of overexploitation. These outcomes highlight the biological sensitivity of *D. trunculus* to changes in selectivity patterns and reinforce the importance of precautionary management measures. Furthermore, we investigate whether interannual recruitment variability under the 25 mm scenario correlates with environmental drivers, aiming to incorporate an ecosystem-informed perspective into the management framework.

Findings suggest that although relaxing size limits may increase short-term yields, such measures could undermine long-term stock viability and reproductive output. We recommend maintaining current size limits or adopting more conservative thresholds to ensure sustainable harvest and to preserve reproductive resilience.

# INTRODUCTION

The wedge clam (*Donax trunculus*) is a key species in sandy beach ecosystems of southern Europe and the Mediterranean, where it plays both ecological and socio-economic roles. Along the Andalusian coast (southern Spain), this bivalve represents one of the most valuable resources for artisanal fisheries, sustaining local livelihoods and contributing significantly to coastal economies [@Schlacher2014; @Defeo2009; @Delgado2017].


The wedge clam fishery in the Gulf of Cádiz is a small-scale artisanal activity that has been under growing pressure from coastal exploitation over the past three decades [REF]. As a result, the fishery now faces significant sustainability and management challenges. Its open-access nature—characterized by low entry barriers, strong economic incentives for participation, and widespread poaching under limited surveillance—further exacerbates its vulnerability [REF]. Although this fishery operates within the administrative limits of the **Doñana Natural Park**, a UNESCO World Heritage and Biosphere Reserve renowned for its biodiversity and ecological significance, signs of overexploitation are becoming increasingly evident. This situation highlights a critical paradox: an artisanal fishery of high cultural and economic importance is exerting growing pressure on a resource located in one of Europe’s emblematic protected areas, where conservation and sustainable use are expected to coexist. Coupled with the species’ biological traits, such as rapid growth, short lifespan, and high sensitivity to environmental variability, these conditions heighten its vulnerability to overexploitation. Evidence from several studies indicates declining trends in biomass and yields of wedge clam populations across southern Europe, raising serious concerns about the long-term sustainability of the fishery [REF].

Management of the fishery in Andalusia has largely relied on input controls, such as seasonal closures and restrictions on fishing gear [@BOJA2023; @Marco2022]. However, these measures have not been sufficient to ensure the sustainability of wedge clam populations. Among the input controls, the minimum legal size (MLS) plays a central role. By prohibiting the harvest of undersized individuals, MLS regulations are intended to protect juveniles, allow clams to reach reproductive maturity [REF], and maintain adequate spawning stock biomass to support recruitment. Although this measure is widely implemented in small-scale bivalve fisheries, the effectiveness of MLS has not yet been systematically assessed for wedge clam in Andalusia. The current MLS is set at 25 mm, but there is ongoing debate about whether this threshold is appropriate given the species’ growth and reproductive characteristics [@Delgado2017; @Colakoglu2014]. Some studies suggest that a lower MLS could enhance short-term yields but may compromise long-term stock viability [@Lamine2020; @Punt2013]. Conversely, maintaining or increasing the MLS could help ensure that a sufficient proportion of the population reaches maturity, thereby supporting recruitment and overall population health [@Defeo2009; @Schlacher2014].

In the Gulf of Cádiz, wedge clams are primarily harvested by hand-gatherers using manual trawls, consisting of a metal blade attached to the lower opening of the gear [@Munoz-Lechuga2018a]. This artisanal fishery is regulated by the Autonomous Community of Andalusia, which has implemented measures such as harvesting size restrictions. However, the effectiveness of these measures depends strongly on the selectivity imposed by the fishing gear. Because the performance of manual trawls is highly sensitive to mesh configuration and fishing technique, the size composition of the catch can vary substantially, directly affecting how well MLS regulations achieve their intended biological objectives. This interplay between gear selectivity and regulatory thresholds underscores the need to explicitly evaluate MLS in combination with the fishing practices that define this artisanal fishery.

The **Project FEMP-04-AND** is a long-term monitoring program initiated in 2013 funded by European Union and Andalusian Community, and has been instrumental in collecting monthly data on wedge clam populations in the Gulf of Cádiz. This program provides information on population structure, fishery activity, and environmental conditions. Together, these datasets capture the main drivers shaping wedge clam dynamics and fishery performance, offering an exceptional opportunity to evaluate the effects of alternative MLS scenarios within a stock assessment framework.

Despite the socio-economic importance of the wedge clam fishery, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding of its population dynamics and sustainability. Most studies have focused on biological aspects such as growth and reproduction [@Delgado2017; @Bargione2021]. However, another aspects related to its status and population variables as recruitment, fishing mortality, spawning biomass that have been scarcely or not at all reported by lack of quality data [REFS], making it challenging to assess their status and recommendation to a sustainable management [REFS]. This knowledge gap is primarily due to the small-scale and data-limited nature of the fishery, which complicates the evaluation of its status and the development of robust management recommendations [REF].


In this context, the wedge clam fishery in the Gulf of Cádiz provides an ideal case study to examine the consequences of varying minimum legal sizes on stock status and key population variables. The aim of this study is to evaluate alternative MLS scenarios for Donax trunculus in Cádiz Gulf using a stock assessment framework, focusing on their effects on status, spawning biomass and recruitment, and implications for sustainable management and policy.

# METHODOLOGY

## Study area

The study area encompasses the main wedge clam harvesting grounds along the southern coast of the Iberian Peninsula, in the Atlantic Ocean along Andalusia. This region is characterized by sandy beaches and estuarine environments, such as the Guadalquivir River estuary, which provide essential habitats for wedge clams, particularly as nursery areas for juveniles and other commercially important species. Shellfishing in Andalusia is regulated through designated management zones (*“Zonas de Marisqueo”*), outside of which harvesting is prohibited [@BOJA2023; @Marco2022]. The Gulf of Cádiz is biologically rich and influenced by diverse oceanographic and climatic conditions, which shape the distribution and abundance of wedge clam populations. Accordingly, the sampling points for the monitoring program were established to cover the full distribution of the resource (Figure \@ref(fig:map1)).

## Data sources

Data are collected on a **monthly basis**, encompassing three complementary dimensions: **population data** (length–frequency distributions, maturity stages, condition indices), **fishery data** (landings, effort, catch-per-unit-effort, size composition of commercial catches), and **environmental data** (sediment granulometry, temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll concentrations). 

Los datos analizados que formaron parte de los inputs del modelo fueron clasificados de acuerdo a su origen. A saber;

a.  Desembarque  artesanal del período (2004-2024), provenientes de las estadisticas oficiales de [IDAPES](https://www.juntadeandalucia.es/agriculturaypesca/idapes/servlet/FrontController) asociados al sector de marisquería del Parque Doñana y cercanías. Cabe señalar que en esta pesquería aun no se realizan procesos de corrección de desembarques y que serán propuestos como escenarios de modelación.

c . Información relativa a los parámetros de historia de vida de la coquina a nivel europeo y local. Esta información está contenida en artículos científicos y reportes que fueron compilados con el fin de parametrizar los modelos de evaluación.

Toda esta información, codigos fuente, bases de datos y Analisis Exploratorio de Datos puede ser encontrado en el siguiente enlace: [Data coquina](https://mauromardones.github.io/EDA_Donux_trunculus_2023/).

The main source of information for these analyzes comes from monitoring program called `FEMP-04` that has been carried out since 2013 on a periodic and monthly basis sampling the beach executed by Instituto Español de Oceanografia (IEO), Cádiz. This monitoring includes taking samples from populations and also emulate commercial activity with a manual trawls which allow obtaining different information components such as densities, recruitment index, lengths compositions in a spatial context. Regarding fisheries data on the wedge clam, it were collected from 2004 to 2023 from the fisheries statistics compiled by the Andalusian Government's Fisheries and Aquaculture Marketing and Transformation Service, part of the Regional Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Rural Development. This service gathers information on daily catches per species and boat at landing sites. In another side, this program take environmental variables as well as primary production (Chlorophyll), salinity, sea temperature among others [MEJOR DESCRIPCION DEL MONITOREO]. All exploratory data analyses from data sources, including data manipulation and templates preparation, can be found in Supplementary Material 1.

## Lengths compositional dependent-fishery data simulation 

The length composition data simulation was designed to evaluate the potential impacts of regulatory changes concerning the minimum legal size (MLS) in the wedge clam (*Donax trunculus*) fishery. The current MLS is set at 25 mm. This simulation framework investigates two dimensions of impact: 1) Biological shift in population structure due to regulatory changes in minimum size, and 2) Assumed fixed selectivity functions in the assessment model centered around alternative mean lengths. To achieve this, a total of eight scenarios were constructed. Four scenarios simulating changes in the population structure with commercial mean lengths centered at 23 mm, 24 mm, 25 mm, and 26 mm

Each simulated population structure was generated using a parametric Gaussian distribution:

$$
f_i = text{dnorm}(x_i; mu, sigma)
$$

Stochasticity was introduced by applying multiplicative noise to represent sampling variability:

$$
P_i = frac{f_i cdot varepsilon_i}{sum_j f_j cdot varepsilon_j}, quad varepsilon_i sim mathcal{N}(1, sigma_{varepsilon}^2)
$$

Where $P_i$ is the resulting proportion at length $x_i$, $phi_i$ is the normal density for length $x_i$ given mean $mu$ and standard deviation $sigma$ and $epsilon_i$ is multiplicative noise drawn from $mathcal{N}(1, sigma_{text{noise}})$. This formulation ensures all resulting proportions are non-negative and sum to one, maintaining their composition nature. Each of the simulated scenarios was incorporated into the Stock Synthesis (SS3) model framework. 

Another four scenarios in which selectivity is fixed in the assessment model to match the same means (23 mm to 26 mm), while retaining the original input data (Figure \@ref(fig:selfix)).

```{r selfix, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Scenarios of fishery selectivity fixed tested in modelling stock assessment in wedg clam in Gulf of Cádiz"}
logistic_selectivity <- function(length, L50, slope) {
  1 / (1 + exp(-slope * (length - L50)))
}
lengths <- seq(10, 35, by = 0.1)  
L50_values <- c(23, 24, 25, 26)
slope <- 5
selectivity_data <- expand.grid(length = lengths, L50 = L50_values) %>%
  mutate(selectivity = logistic_selectivity(length, L50, slope),
         L50 = factor(L50, levels = L50_values))

hist_data <- data.frame(length = rnorm(1000, mean = 25, sd = 2.5))

hist_counts <- hist(hist_data$length, 
                    breaks = seq(15, 35, by = 1), 
                    plot = FALSE)
hist_df <- data.frame(
  length = hist_counts$mids,
  density = hist_counts$counts / max(hist_counts$counts)
)

selfix <- ggplot() +
  geom_col(data = hist_df, aes(x = length, y = density),
           fill = "grey70",
           color="grey20", alpha = 0.3, width = 1) +
  geom_line(data = selectivity_data, aes(x = length, 
                                         y = selectivity, 
                                         color = L50), 
            size = 1.2) +
  labs(
    title = "",
    x = "Wedge clam length (mm)",
    y = "Selectivity / Normalized frequency",
    color = expression(L[50])
  ) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 10) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "E", name = "Minimum Legal Size (MLS)") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  ylim(0, 1.05)
selfix
```

This dual approach allows for evaluating the effect of hypothetical changes in population structure (e.g., as a result of shifting LMLS), and the influence of assuming specific selectivity patterns in the assessment model, independent of actual data structure.

By combining observed and simulated datasets, this strategy supports a robust evaluation of how assumed biological structure and model assumptions interact, particularly regarding exploitation patterns and size-based selectivity in this artisanal fishery.


## Dynamic population model to wedga clam

El modelo de dinámica poblacional de la coquina, corresponde a un enfoque de evaluación del tipo estadístico con estructura de edad, donde la dinámica progresa avanzando en el tiempo t, y las capturas son causantes de la mortalidad por pesca F, la mortalidad natural es constante `M = 0.99` (Tabla ref{Tab1}). La relación entre la población y las capturas responde a la base de la ecuación de Baranov, y se consideran para el modelo y estimaciones el rango de edad entre 1 a 5+ (años). Sin embargo, las estimaciones del modelo tienen su origen en la edad cero sobre la base de una condición inicial estado estable. La dinámica esta modelada por un reclutamiento tipo Beverton y Holt.


De manera sencilla, un modelo de evaluación reproduce la dinámica poblacional de coquina a lo largo del tiempo. Este modelo incorpora parámetros biológicos clave como tasas de crecimiento, tasas de mortalidad, reclutamiento y biomasa desovante. Normalmente, el modelo se formula utilizando ecuaciones matemáticas que describen cómo estos parámetros interactúan para determinar la abundancia y distribución de coquina en el área de estudio. La ecuación de estado de creciiento poblacional de coquina puede representarse como:

[
N_t = N_{t-1} cdot e^{(r - M)} + R
]

Donde:
- (N_t) es abundancia de coquina en el tiempo (t).
- (N_{t-1}) abundancia de coquina en pasos de tiempo previos.
- (r) es la tasa de crecimiento poblacional intrinseca.
- (M) es la tasa de mortalidad natural.
- (R) es el reclutamiento de nuevos individuos al stock.



## Model conditioning

La ecuación descrita en el punto `2.2` describe la dinámica básica de la población de coquina, con la abundancia cambiando con el tiempo debido al crecimiento, la mortalidad y el reclutamiento. Junto a esta ecuación, otros submodelos asociados como crecimiento individual, selectividad, madurez, captura a la edad entre otros estan configurados en SS3. Este plataforma de evaluación de stock está diseñada como un modelo estructurado con dinámica en edad y datos en talla, en la clase de modelo denominado *Modelo de análisis integrado*. SS3 tiene un sub-modelo poblacional de stock que simula crecimiento, madurez, fecundidad, reclutamiento, movimiento, y procesos de mortalidad, y sub-modelos de observation y valores esperados para diferentes tipos de datos. El modelo es codificado en C++ con parámetros de estimación activados por diferenciación automática (ADMB) [@Methot2013]. El análisis de resultados y salidas emplea herramientas de R e interfase gráfica de la librería `r4ss` (<https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss>) [@Taylor2019] y `ss3diags`  [@Henning2023].


Las rutinas y datos de este proceso metodologico de evaluaciónpueden ser encontrados en el repositorio de [SA_Donax_trunculus](https://github.com/MauroMardones/SA_Donax_trunculus)



## Conceptual model

A statistical modelling implemented as a stock assessment approach require special considerations regarding their biology and spatial structure arranged as a conceptual model. The conceptual model for wedge clam in Gulf of Cadiz includes an assumption about pool dynamics and closed populations, necessary assumption for this species [@Jamieson1995a]. Although there are designated shellfishing areas, currently used as reference points and management blocks, these cannot be assumed as separate population units. On the contrary, they are local populations interconnected through the larval phase of wedge clams with nearby local banks or populations. However, they all have a physical limit, which in turn constitutes the boundaries of the functional population on which we base the stock assessment using an integrated model where population is closed for emigration and immigration, and their spatial distribution and interactions occur within this single, cohesive population (Figure \@ref(fig:map1)). Then, the main assumptions of the catch-at-length model are: a) wedge clam stock consists of several local populations that are interconnected through the drift of gametes and planktonic larvae [@DiBacco2006; @Gaynes2005; @Pineda2007], and all together constitute a closed population to external components, mainly due to physical and environmental limits along the coast, b) natural mortality is known and constant across years and ages, c) natural and fishing mortality occur simultaneously (Baranov equation), d) the vulnerability pattern of individuals is age-dependent and follows a logistic model, e) the model assumes that population are composed of no more than 4-5 age groups, f) recruitment (second year of age) results from the spawning of close patch or beds (local populations) and its survival is mainly influenced by environmental factors [@Okamoto2020] and g) the integrated model considers interannual fluctuations of growth dynamics, maturity and reproduction, with a spawning pulse per year.  Given the current knowledge of wedge clam distribution in the Gulf of Cádiz, no significant populations occur outside this area, supporting the assumption of a closed population. This framework provides the basis for evaluating stock dynamics while incorporating local population connectivity, recruitment, and habitat constraints.


```{r map1, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.cap="Conceptual model to stock assessment in wedge clam in Cádiz Gulf, Spain."}
knitr::include_graphics("Fig/Conceptual.png")
```



Our conceptual model for the stock assessment of wedge clam (Donax trunculus) in the Gulf of Cádiz is based on two fundamental assumptions outlined by Jamison (1995): the existence of a closed population and the presence of a dynamic pool. The model considers the functional stock assessment population as a whole, encompassing multiple local populations (beds or patches) that are constrained by bathymetric and beach morphology limits. Local populations are depicted as discrete units connected through larval dispersal, allowing for exchange within the dynamic pool.



## Stock assessment model

Like most invertebrates, wedge clam is a species for which aging is complex [@Punt2013]. Therefore, a size-structured model with age dynamics is used, which is transformed through a transition matrix based on the probabilities of age groups relative to the detailed structure. Integrated models have the capacity to reproduce the age dynamics of these populations and simultaneously transform them into population variables. The following equations provides a general mathematical expression of both biological and fishing processes that partly explain the population dynamics applicable to wedge clams. For more details, please refer to Supplement 1.

$$
N_{t,a} = 
begin{cases} 
R_t & text{if } a=1, forall t 
N_{t-1,a-1} e^{-(F_{t-1,a-1} + M)} & text{if } 1 < a < A - 1, forall t 
N_{t-1,a-1} e^{-(F_{t-1,a-1} + M)} (1 - e^{-(F_{t,a} + M)}) & text{if } a = A, forall t = 1 
N_{t-1,a} e^{-(F_{t,a} + M)} & text{if } a = A, t > 1 
end{cases}
$$
This equation defines the number of individuals ((N_{t,a})) in the population at time (t) and age (a). For age (a=1) at all times (t), recruitment ((R_t)) is used: (N_{t,a} = R_t). For ages (1 < a < A-1), the number of individuals from the previous time step (t-1) and age (a-1) is adjusted by the exponential decay due to fishing mortality and natural mortality ((M)). For the last age class (a=A) at (t > 1), the number of individuals is adjusted similarly but includes an additional factor for survival probability. For age (a=A) at (t > 1), the number of individuals from the previous time step (t-1) and same age (a) is adjusted by the exponential decay in the mathematical form: (N_{t-1,a} e^{-(F_{t,a} + )}).


$$
B_t = sum_{a} (P_{a,t} N_{a,t} w_l)
$$
This equation calculates the total biomass ((B_t)) at time (t) where (B_t) is the sum of the product of the proportion of mature individuals ((P_{a,t})), the number of individuals ((N_{a,t})), and the weight at age ((w_a)) across all age classes (a).

$$
BD_t = sum_{a} left( P_{a,t} N_{a,t} e^{-0.91Z_a} right) w_a O_i
$$
Spawning biomass equation show (BD_t) as the sum of the product of the proportion of mature individuals ((P_{a,t})), the number of individuals ((N_{a,t})) adjusted by the exponential decay factor weighted by total mortality, the weight at age ((w_a)), and a vector of maturity ogive (O_i) across all age classes.

$$
N_{a,t+1} = frac{alpha BD_{t-1}}{beta + BD_{t-1}} e^{epsilon_t + 0.5sigma_epsilon^2}, 
alpha = frac{4hR_0}{(5h-1)}, quad beta = frac{(1-h)BD_0}{(5h-1)}
$$
The recruitment submodel describe abundance ((N_{a,t+1})) to the next year (t+1) based on the spawning biomass ((BD_{t-1})) from the previous year, where (alpha) and (beta) are parameters defined below, (epsilon_t) is a random error term, and (sigma_epsilon^2) is the variance of the error. Parameters (alpha) is a parameter related to the maximum recruitment ((R_0)) and the steepness ((h)) of the stock-recruitment relationship. (beta) is a parameter related to the virgin spawning biomass ((BD_0)) and the steepness ((h)) is the parameters that regulate rate of change of relationship between stock and recruitment.


In the conditioning of the model, the estimation of spawning biomass was conducted at the beginning of the year, while recruitment was considered a dual event occurring around middle and the end of the year. In the recruitment estimation process, a diffuse stock-recruit relationship (steepness 0.75) was incorporated, and variations in recruitment were modeled as deviations from the virgin recruitment `R0`, assuming 2004 as the initial year (Table @ref(tab:parainit)). Fishing mortality was estimated as the simple average of the `F` for age classes 1 to 5. Density was assumed to be a proxy for the estimated biomasses [@Caddy2004], obtained from population surveys and proportional to the vulnerable biomass of the population, with catchability (`q`) estimated in the model. The `q` parameters were estimated from initial parameters specified in Table @ref(tab:parainit)} for both population monitoring data and commercial data. All selectivity patterns, which relate the observed size compositions from the commercial and population samples to the dynamics, were estimated using a logistic function. The parameters `p1` (size at the inflection point of the curve) and `p2` (95% selection) are estimated by the model from the initial values specified in Table @ref(tab:parainit).

The stock assessment model to wedge clam was configured using Stock Synthesis v3.30.21 (SS3 hereafter) [@Methot2013; @Methot2020]. SS3 is a widely used software tool for assessing fish and invertebrate populations widely used in the main regional fishing organizations to have approximations of the population dynamics of the exploited resource as well as to support management decisions. SS3 is a structured stock evaluation model, in the class of models called *"Integrated stock evaluation analysis model"* and has a set of sub-model that simulates growth, maturity, fecundity, recruitment,  and mortality processes, and observation, with expected values for different types of data. The model is coded in Automatic Differentiation Model Builder (ADMB) [@Fournier2012; @Methot2013: @Methot2020] with estimation parameters by likelihood. The methodology employed by SS3 involves a comprehensive and integrated approach, utilizing majority sources data from *FEMP-04* monitoring program and official statistics. All analysis were executed in R-CRAN [@R-base] and the graphical interface of the SS3 through `r4ss` [@Taylor2019]  and `ss3diags` packages [@Winker2023]. Life history parameters, like growth, weight-length relation, natural mortality and maturity was used as priors to model initial condition was taken from @Delgado2017, @Colakoglu2014 and  @Lamine2020 and can be found in Table @ref(tab:parainit). Source data and temporal scale used in this stock assessment for the wedge clam in Cádiz Gulf begin in 2004, and the monitoring program data start in 2013 (Figure @ref(fig:data)). For technical descriptions in SS3 modeling, including sub-models like maturity, growth, observation, process, estimators, and associated likelihood components, see @Methot2020. Model performance and diagnosis was established using the @Carvalho2021b and @winker2021 approach to check Hessian matrix, joint residual plots and a hindcasting cross-validation through mean absolute scaled error (MASE). Diagnostic tests for wedge clam model with SS3 were performed with the `ss3diags` package [@Winker2023].

## Environmental variable correlation

To model the relationship between recruitment of wedge clam and chlorophyll concentration, a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was used gathering recruitment estimates from stock assessment model outputs and chlorophyll concentration data taken from the beach monitoring program. These datasets need to be merged based on matching annual periods. Using the `dplyr` library, data can be pre-processed to handle missing values and ensure consistency. For the GLM from the `stats` package [@Bates2015] will be utilized, specifying a suitable family distribution (e.g., Gaussian for normal distribution) for the recruitment data. Chlorophyll concentration will be used as the explanatory variable. Model diagnostics was performed using the `easystast` packages [@Ludecke2022] to check for assumptions such as homoscedasticity and normality of residuals.

# RESULTS

Length Frecuency Data (LFD) show notable variations in size distribution are observed across different years and months, indicating significant temporal changes in the population structure. These data are critical and was utilized in the integrated stock assessment model in annual scale. Performance indices, CPUE and density estimates through monitoring were standarized and show similar trend signals. Standardized indices of abundance for wedge clam from 2016 to 2023, comparing commercial and population fractions. Both indices show variability over the years, with a general upward trend peaking around 2021 for the population fraction and 2020 for the commercial fraction. The commercial index shows greater fluctuations, peaking in 2020, while the population index peaks in 2021, indicating a slight lag in population response. After the peaks, both indices decline sharply, suggesting a decrease in abundance. The close alignment between the indices in most years indicates that trends in commercial catches are reflective of overall population trends. This alignment suggests effective monitoring and management practices.


The Figure @ref(fig:fits) present residual analyses for the length distributions of wedge clam samples, comparing commercial and population fractions from 2014 to 2023. For the commercial fraction residuals across the years show some variability around the main length class of 2-3 cm, indicating occasional discrepancies between observed and predicted lengths. Years 2014 and 2015 has notable deviations, potentially due to under- or over-estimation by the model in these length classes. However, overall, the residuals are generally small and evenly distributed, indicating a reasonable fit.
The population fraction shows a similar pattern, with residuals clustered around the central length classes of 2-3 cm. There is noticeable variability in the size of residuals over the years, particularly in 2017 and 2020 with substantial discrepancies. Regarding estimation of main population variables, Figure @ref(fig:varpob) displays six panels summarizing the stock assessment results for the wedge clam population dynamics from 2005 to 2025 using the delta-Multivariate lognormal approximation (MVLN) regarding @winker2021 and @Winker2023. Each panel focuses on different key indicators of the population variables, status stock and fishing pressure. The first panel shows the ratio of spawning stock biomass (SSB) to the biomass at 40% of the unfished level (SSB40). Initially, the ratio is above 1, indicating a healthy stock level. However, it declines steadily until around 2020, reaching approximately 1, suggesting the stock is close to being overfished. After 2020, a slight recovery is observed, though the ratio remains near the threshold, indicating a cautious improvement in stock health. The second panel illustrates the ratio of fishing mortality (F) to the fishing mortality at maximum sustainable yield (FMSY). From 2005 to 2020, the ratio fluctuates significantly, often exceeding 1, indicating periods of overfishing. Peaks are observed around 2015 and 2020, suggesting particularly high fishing pressure during these years. Post-2020, the ratio declines but remains variable. The third panel presents the actual spawning stock biomass (SSB) over time. There is a declining trend from 2005 to around 2015, followed by a more gradual decline until 2020. After 2020, the SSB shows signs of recovery, although it remains lower than the initial levels observed in 2005. This indicates efforts to rebuild the stock might be having a positive effect. The fourth panel shows the absolute fishing mortality (F) over time. The fishing mortality rate exhibits considerable variability, with notable peaks around 2015 and 2020, correlating with the high F/FMSY ratios. The fifth panel depicts the number of recruits entering the population each year. Recruitment levels remain relatively stable from 2005 to 2015, with some variability but no clear trend. After 2015, recruitment appears to become more uncertain, with wider confidence intervals, especially around 2020, this could be due to environmental factors that impact in this variable. The sixth panel shows the annual catch of wedge clams which increases from 2005 to 2020, with significant peak is observed around 2020 followed by a slight decline (Figure @ref(fig:tabvarpob)).

Regarding status based on BRP proposed respect to spawning stock biomass (SSB) and fishing mortality (F) over time to the wedge clam,  SSB/SSB40 trends indicates a significant decline from 2005, reaching a minimum around 2015, where the ratio falls well below 1, suggesting that the stock was overfished during this period. Post-2015, there is a gradual recovery, with the ratio approaching and eventually exceeding 1 around 2020, indicating potential stock rebuilding to sustainable levels. The F/FMSY trend highlights fluctuating fishing mortality rates, with several peaks exceeding 1, notably around 2015 and 2020, indicating periods of overfishing. The variability and peaks suggest challenges in maintaining fishing pressure within sustainable limits. However, the declining trend post-2020 suggests some reduction in fishing pressure. Overall, the population status of wedge clam shows periods of overfishing and low biomass around 2015, followed by signs of recovery in stock biomass and a reduction in fishing mortality in recent years. These trends highlight the dynamic nature of the population and the impact of management measures on stock recovery (Figure @ref(fig:status)).

Although these indicators have been widely used by local administration to promote proper management, the use of empirical indicators and their separate analysis can lead to erroneous interpretations, especially when conflicting signals arise [REFS]. However, this process has lacked appropriate metrics for assessing its dynamics, population variables, and clear reference points for management and decision-making. On the other hand, without clear, specific, and measurable reference points or management objectives over time are factors that can lead to the failure of fishery management and, consequently, the population [REFS @Punt2016]. In these sense, and taking advantage of the variety of data collected over the past ten years by official fishery statistical and monitoring programs, incorporating this information into an integrated stock assessment models is a next step in this fishery. Integrated stock assessment models are relatively recent for invertebrate and benthic species. Examples such as @Baro2018; @Roa-Ureta2015; @Canales2021; @Smith2004b; @Chen2003d; @Chen2003b and others have opened the door to this approach for invertebrate stock resources. 

To use a model-based approach in this species we need to established a biological reference framework. In this context, most of the modern and currently valid international fisheries management reference frameworks are based on the concept of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) (Hilborn and Walters, 1992; Chen and Paloheimo, 1998; Walters, 1998). Based on the background, to model population dynamics using an integrated approach for wedge clam population provide reliable estimates parameters using appropriate statistical methods to estimated state (biomass, abundance) and flow (fishing mortality or exploitation rates) variables in the distribution area and the fishery, which contain references based on the previously described MSY proxies. In this analysis, we propose using data from the wedge clam fishery monitoring program and establish the first stock assessment process using an integrated length-at-catch model in wedge clam in Cádiz Gulf based on reference levels that diagnoses the exploitation status and recommendations for sustainable harvesting using *ad-hoc* Biological Reference Points (BRP). With this we provide fishery advice for this sensitive ecosystem in the Gulf of Cadiz enhancing interest in its management and conservation.

Most of the benthic resource fisheries belong to the “S” type, i.e. small-scale, spatially structured and sedentary stocks (Orensanz et al., 2005). Due to the metapopulation structure of benthic resources, in which subpopulations of adults are connected with each other by means of larval or juvenile dispersal, the recruitment into local populations could depend not only on local stocks, but also on neighboring populations (Hilborn et al., 2005). This produces variability in recruitment at different spatial and temporal scales (Lima et al., 2000). The strength of the intercon- nections within the metapopulation dynamics, which strongly affects the variability of local populations of the resources, is something rarely addressed in management approaches

The proper management of a fishery requires a exhaustive knowledge of the biological and population components that influence into dynamics, like biomass and fishing mortality, as well as complete scientific knowledge related to their reproductive and life history parameters [@Delgado2015].

Stock assessment analysis through an integrated model in monthly data and with dynamic age. It is configured as the first Inside of population variables and exploitation status of coquina in the Gulf of Cádiz. 

Generally, the stock assessment of this type of exploited species is carried out with direct methods [@huges1981; @Bouzaidi2020a; @Zhang2021; @Lamine2020; @Colakoglu2014; @Derbalietal2016].  These methods are useful for establishing current information through snapshot, but they lack references that consider the fishing history and biological or empirical references to give advice to management. On the other hand, there are exercises with indirect methods which have been applied in various groups and types of species around the world, from gastropods [], bivalves[], echinoderms[] and cephalopods[]. Here reference levels are already provided in which the level of exploitation can be identified and thereby provide scientific advice for decision making. However, in most of these examples cited, the Data condition and sufficiency points to the application of poor standard models, in which dynamics are represented through performance per recruit or global models. In wedge clam, has a robust monthly monitoring program, which allows the collection of various pieces of information, ranging from empirical population indicators to environmental variables. We must add to this the abundant literature referring to reproductive parameters and life history of the species. With these elements, it was possible to apply an integrated model with monthly data and size dynamics, which used 10-year time series of landings, sizes, relative abundance indicators, among others. With these components, we model the population dynamics of coquina, obtaining model indicators based on spawning biomass and fishing mortality.

Regarding the state of exploitation, we used common Biological Reference Points for this type of resources, with which we were able to identify metrics and levels with scientific rigor.


This trend suggests increasing fishing effort up to 2020, potentially aligning with the periods of higher fishing mortality and overfishing. Overall, the stock assessment indicates periods of overfishing, particularly around 2015 and 2020, with subsequent efforts to reduce fishing mortality and rebuild the stock. The spawning stock biomass shows signs of recovery post-2020, but the stock remains near critical levels, necessitating continued careful management to ensure sustainability.

Proxies for BRPs have mostly been applied due to the difficulty of estimating MSY [@Hilborn2002; @Punt2013]. For example, initially to avoid growth overfishing, using F0.1 as the target BRP and Fmax as the limit BRP, based on yield per recruit [@Gabriel1975 and @Goodyear1993]. Then, to prevent recruitment overfishing, the use of a target BRP F40%SPR and a limit BRP F20%SPR is proposed, based on spawning biomass per recruit (Clark 1991 and 1993, Mace 1994, Mace and Sissenwine 1993). More recently, 40%SB0 (spawning biomass corresponding to 40% of virgin spawning biomass) has also been used as the target BRP and 20%SB0 as the limit (citation). Worldwide, reference frameworks for invertebrates fisheries have been proposed to give advice into management [@Baro2018; @Caddy1996d; @Caddy2004; @Canales2021; @FIPA2017; @Roa-Ureta2015; @Smith2004b; @Smith2004c]. For example, in Maine, it was estimated to use (F_{0.1}) as a reference [@Chen2003; @Chen2003b].  propose the use of BRPs based on spawning potential ratio (SPR) as a proxy for MSY according to  for California benthic fisheries. In this sense, the use of BRP that aim for MSY is proposed, according to the global fisheries scientific community.

The BRP forwedge clams  was estimated based on an analysis of yield per recruit and spawning biomass per recruit (SPR), given the vector of mean weights at age, the fleet selectivity estimated in the model, and the age-specific maturity ogive for virgin recruitment ( R_0 = 1.0 ). A conservation target was defined as a proxy value of MSY equivalent to a 40% reduction in spawning biomass relative to virgin spawning biomass (40%SPR/SPR0), ensuring a 60% SPR escape level


The management and conservation context in which this fishery is located is of special interest. On the one hand, this fishery occurs on a sandy beach with easy access and low entry barriers for commercial and recreational fishing, which makes it a vulnerable species and it is common to observe unauthorized fishermen hand-dredging and tourists hand gathering this valuable fishing resource from beaches, making official statistics unreliable and making difficult stock assessment and resource management [@Delgado2017]. On the other hand, the coquina populations are located within the conservation figure of the Doñana national Park, which aims to generate conservation measures for this and other species.


And versus and varied stock valuation studies of other invertebrate resources have been carried out in the Iberian Peninsula. The greatest number of these have been carried out with a poor data approach, since these resources generally lack pieces of information that vary with which a more sophisticated structural model can be made. In this case and thanks to the monitoring projects funded by the European Union, it was possible to gather and standardize a database of more than 10 years on a monthly basis, which allowed us to model this resource with a monthly dynamic to generate the global advices.

consequently, the combination of environmental changes, uncontrolled fishing pressure and weak recruitment could lead to the over exploitation of this species.

"However, very rarely, and due to the changing characteristics of the habitat, it is possible to identify the impacts of these fluctuating conditions on fishing and vice versa.

To identify this, we have used a model..."

The working group considers that this resource contains these pieces of information collected by monitoring programs over the last 10 years with which population dynamics can be modeled based on scientific rigor and thereby give precise recommendations for management and also in its conservation.


Therefore, fishery activity must be precautionary to avoid impacting dependent species in the trophic web and related communities. 

Recruitment responds to mainly stochastic processes where the stock-recruitment function is diffuse.



In the X North fishery unit, the results of the indirect assessment of thewedge clam stock indicate that from a low exploitation condition until 1975, the stock was subject to low fishing mortalities. It then experienced significant fishing levels between 1975 and 1999, with average maximum exploitation rates of 80% of the resource biomass. Subsequently, fishing mortality levels were irregular, remaining above the target fishing mortality in the last five years. In 2016, the removal rate was estimated at ( F = 0.176 ) per year. The impact of the extractive activity is shown through the ratio between the estimated spawning biomass and the long-term spawning biomass, which is estimated within the model based on the average recruitments observed in the analyzed series. The reproductive potential of the stock reached its lowest levels in 1998 and 2013 (11%). For the last year, under the base scenario, the spawning biomass is about 22%, only two points above a reference limit level for the resource.

From the definition of the BRPs and the status indicators, a phase diagram (Base Case) for thewedge clam in the X North zone was constructed. Consequently, based on the observations, the resource initially faced low exploitation levels, then quickly reached overfishing levels. However, the situation has progressed to collapse in recent years, keeping thewedge clam in the X North zone in an overexploitation state. The reduction ratio of virgin biomass and exploitation rates place thewedge clam at the upper limit of overexploitation, as its spawning biomass is above the biomass that generates MSY (SPR/SPRMS = 0.55), with no risk of falling into over-exploitation since ( P(SPR < SPRMS) = 0 ). Fishing mortality is above the target with ( F/FRMS = 3.167 ), indicating signs of overfishing.

(figure kobe plot)

The Y-axis represents the ratio of the reduction in estimated spawning biomass in the stock assessment relative to the target biomass (SPRMS), which defines the status of under-exploitation, full exploitation, overexploitation, and collapse. The X-axis represents the ratio of fishing mortality from the assessment relative to the F40% considered the target to achieve MSY (proxy). Above the continuous line (F/FRMS > 1), the condition of overfishing is defined.
