# ABSTRACT

This study evaluates the implications of different minimun legal harvest size on the population dynamics and management outcomes of the wedge clam (*Donax trunculus*) fishery in the Gulf of Cádiz. Using an integrated length-to-age stock assessment model implemented in Stock Synthesis, we analyze four selectivity scenarios based on minimum legal sizes: 26, 25 (current regulation), 24 and 23 mm. The objective is to assess how variations in legal size thresholds affect estimates of recruitment, total biomass, and spawning stock biomass, and to determine the potential consequences for the sustainability of the fishery.

Each scenario is modeled under consistent structural assumptions and data inputs, allowing for meaningful comparison across population metrics. Model inputs are derived from a robust, ongoing monitoring program for *D. trunculus*, which includes monthly data on population structure, fishery effort and landings, and environmental variables. This comprehensive dataset strengthens the model’s ability to reflect realistic biological and fishery conditions.

Preliminary results indicate that decreasing the minimum legal size leads to a marked reduction in spawning biomass and alters recruitment dynamics (from tons to tonss ReDACTAR), potentially increasing the risk of overexploitation. These outcomes highlight the biological sensitivity of *D. trunculus* to changes in selectivity patterns and reinforce the importance of precautionary management measures. 

Findings suggest that although relaxing size limits may increase short-term yields, such measures could undermine long-term stock viability and reproductive output. We recommend maintaining current size limits or adopting more conservative thresholds to ensure sustainable harvest and to preserve reproductive resilience.

# INTRODUCTION

The wedge clam (*Donax trunculus*) is a key species in sandy beach ecosystems of southern Europe and the Mediterranean, where it plays both ecological and socio-economic roles [REF, REF]. Along the Andalusian coast of southern Spain, this bivalve represents one of the most valuable resources for artisanal fisheries, sustaining local livelihoods and contributing significantly to coastal economies [@Schlacher2014; @Defeo2009; @Delgado2017]. The species' ecological importance extends beyond its commercial value, as it serves as a critical component of sandy beach food webs and contributes to nutrient cycling and sediment dynamics in these dynamic environments.

The wedge clam fishery in the Gulf of Cádiz exemplifies the challenges facing small-scale artisanal fisheries worldwide. Over the past three decades, this fishery has experienced growing pressure from increased coastal exploitation, urban development, and intensified fishing effort [REF]. The fishery's open-access nature (characterized by low entry barriers, strong economic incentives for participation, and widespread illegal harvesting under limited surveillance further) exacerbates its vulnerability to overexploitation [REF]. This fishery presents a critical management paradox: while the fishery operates within the administrative limits of the Doñana Natural Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and Biosphere Reserve [REF] renowned for its biodiversity and ecological significance, signs of resource depletion are becoming increasingly evident [REF]. The coexistence of an economically important artisanal fishery with conservation objectives in one of Europe's most emblematic protected areas highlights the urgent need for science-based management approaches that can balance socio-economic needs with ecosystem sustainability.

The biological characteristics of wedge clam make it particularly susceptible to overexploitation. The species exhibits rapid growth, a relatively short lifespan (4-5 years), and high sensitivity to environmental variability, particularly temperature fluctuations and wind regimes [REF]. These traits, combined with its aggregated distribution patterns and accessibility to harvesters, create conditions that can lead to rapid population declines if fishing pressure exceeds the population capacity for recovery. Evidence from several studies across the Pacific [REF], Mediterranean [REF] and Atlantic coasts indicates rapid declining trends in biomass and collapsed fisheries in wedge clam, raising serious concerns about the long-term sustainability of these fisheries [@Delgado2017; @Lamine2020, REF].

Current management of the Andalusian wedge clam fishery relies primarily on input controls implemented through a system of designated management zones (Zonas de Marisqueo), outside of which harvesting is prohibited [@BOJA2023; @Marco2022]. These measures include seasonal closures, restrictions on fishing gear specifications, and most importantly, minimum legal size (MLS) regulations. The MLS serves as a fundamental tool for protecting juvenile recruitment by prohibiting the harvest of individuals below a specified size threshold, theoretically allowing clams to reach reproductive maturity and contribute to spawning stock biomass. The current MLS is set at 25 mm shell length, but the biological and fishery effectiveness of this threshold remains poorly understood.

The debate surrounding optimal MLS values for wedge clam reflects broader challenges in shellfish management. Proponents of lower size limits argue that relaxed regulations could enhance short-term yields and provide greater economic flexibility for fishers, particularly during periods of low abundance [@Colakoglu2014]. Conversely, advocates for maintaining or increasing size limits emphasize the need to protect spawning stock biomass and ensure adequate recruitment to support long-term population viability [@Defeo2009; @Schlacher2014]. This debate is further complicated by the interaction between regulatory thresholds and fishing gear selectivity, as the performance of manual trawls used in this artisanal fishery can vary substantially depending on mesh configuration and fishing technique.

The complexity of evaluating MLS effectiveness requires moving beyond simple biological considerations to embrace integrated approaches that consider population dynamics, fishery selectivity, and recruitment processes simultaneously. Stock assessment models, particularly those that integrate age-structured population dynamics with fishery selectivity patterns [REF, REF] , provide the necessary analytical framework to quantify trade-offs between different management scenarios and their consequences for population and fishery sustainability. However, the application of such integrated models to wedge clam populations has been historically limited due to data constraints, the challenges associated with aging short-lived invertebrates, and the high variability characteristic of sandy beach ecosystems.

Recent advances in statistical modeling and the availability of comprehensive long-term datasets now make it possible to develop stock assessments for data-limited fisheries such as wedge clam. The FEMP-04-AND monitoring program, initiated in 2013 and funded by the European Union and Andalusian Community, has been instrumental in collecting monthly data on wedge clam populations throughout the Gulf of Cádiz. This program provides unprecedented information on population structure, fishery activity, and environmental conditions, capturing the main drivers that shape wedge clam dynamics and fishery performance over more than a decade of observations.

Despite the species' economic importance and the availability of monitoring data, comprehensive stock assessments for wedge clam populations remain scarce in the scientific literature. Most studies have focused on specific biological aspects such as growth parameters, reproductive cycles, or local population surveys [@Delgado2017; @Bargione2021], while population-level variables such as recruitment strength, fishing mortality rates, and spawning stock biomass have been poorly characterized. This knowledge gap primarily stems from the small-scale and data-limited nature of the fishery, which has complicated the development of quantitative assessments and evidence-based management recommendations.

This study represents the first comprehensive stock assessment of *Donax trunculus* using an integrated statistical modeling approach in the Gulf of Cádiz region. The specific objectives are: (1) to quantify the population-level impacts of alternative MLS scenarios, specifically evaluating whether a reduction from the current 25 mm threshold to 23 mm results in changes in spawning stock biomass, (2) to assess how changes in MLS affect fishing mortality patterns and recruitment dynamics across the four management scenarios (23, 24, 25, and 26 mm), (3) to determine the trade-offs between short-term yield increases and long-term stock sustainability under each MLS scenario, and (4) to provide quantitative management recommendations based on population reference points and risk assessment. Unlike previous studies that have focused primarily on biological parameters or local population surveys, this research integrates over a decade of comprehensive monitoring data within a robust stock assessment framework, enabling for the first time a population-scale evaluation of management alternatives for this economically important species. The findings will provide essential scientific support for evidence-based fishery management decisions in one of Europe's most significant wedge clam fishing regions, with broader implications for the sustainable management of artisanal bivalve fisheries in similar ecosystems.

# METHODOLOGY

## Study area

The study area encompasses the main wedge clam harvesting grounds along the southern coast of the Iberian Peninsula, in the Atlantic Ocean along Andalusia. This region is characterized by sandy beaches and estuarine environments, such as the Guadalquivir River estuary, which provide essential habitats for wedge clams, particularly as nursery areas for juveniles and other commercially important species. The Gulf of Cádiz is biologically rich and influenced by diverse oceanographic and climatic conditions, which shape the distribution and abundance of wedge clam populations. The Figure \@ref(fig:areaconcept) (Top panel) highlights several sampling sites distributed along the coastal zone, ranging approximately from 36.6°N to 37.4°N latitude and from 7.6°W to 6.2°W longitude. The sites are numbered (1 to 11 and M) and cover the main estuarine and coastal sectors of the region, including the mouth of the Guadalquivir River in the east and the coastal waters near Doñana and Huelva to the west.

## Conceptual model

A statistical modelling implemented as a stock assessment approach require special considerations regarding their biology and spatial structure arranged as a conceptual model. The conceptual model for wedge clam in Gulf of Cadiz includes an assumption about pool dynamics and closed populations, necessary assumption for this species [@Jamieson1995a]. While the wedge clam is distributed and managed across designated management zones (*Zonas de Marisqueo*), these zones should not be assumed to represent distinct population units. On the contrary, they are local populations interconnected through the larval phase with nearby local banks or populations. All these local populations have a physical limit, which in turn constitutes the boundaries of the functional population on which we base the stock assessment. The schematic diagram (Bottom panel in Figure \@ref(fig:areaconcept)) illustrates the conceptual framework of population structure: a dynamic pool composed of functional unit populations, which in turn are subdivided into local unit populations (beds or patches). Connectivity among these units is maintained through gametic exchange and larval dispersal, influenced by bathymetric and benthic morphology features of the beaches assuming a single, cohesive population structure. Given the current knowledge of wedge clam distribution in the Gulf of Cádiz, no significant populations occur outside this area, supporting the assumption of a closed population. This framework aligns with the assumptions outlined by @Jamieson1995a, which emphasize the importance of considering both local population dynamics and broader connectivity patterns in stock assessments. Then, the main assumptions of the catch-at-length model are: a) wedge clam stock consists of several local populations that are interconnected through the drift of gametes and planktonic larvae [@DiBacco2006; @Gaynes2005; @Pineda2007], and where the impacts from fishing activities will affect the entire population as a whole, b) natural mortality is known and constant across years and ages, c) natural and fishing mortality occur simultaneously (Baranov equation), d) the vulnerability pattern of individuals is age-dependent and follows a logistic model, e) the model assumes that population are composed of no more than 4-5 age groups, f) recruitment (second year of age) results from the spawning of close patch or beds (local populations) and its survival is mainly influenced by environmental factors [@Okamoto2020] and g) the integrated model considers interannual fluctuations of growth dynamics, maturity and reproduction, with a spawning pulse per year.   This framework provides the basis for evaluating stock dynamics while incorporating local population connectivity, recruitment, and habitat constraints.

## Data sources

For any stock assessment analysis, data sources are of paramount importance. To this end, a comprehensive compilation of available information was carried out from public institutions, private entities, and the scientific literature. The data analyzed as inputs for the model were classified according to their origin, as follows:

a. Artisanal landings from the period 2004–2024, obtained from the official statistics of [IDAPES](https://www.juntadeandalucia.es/agriculturaypesca/idapes/servlet/FrontController), associated with the shellfishing sector of Doñana Park and surrounding areas. It should be noted that in this fishery no correction processes for landings have yet been applied.

b. The primary data source for this study is the long-term monitoring program `FEMP-04-AND`, which has been conducted since 2013 by the Instituto Español de Oceanografía (IEO) in Cádiz. This program involves monthly sampling of wedge clam populations along the coast, providing comprehensive data on population structure, fishery activity, and environmental conditions. The monitoring includes both population surveys and simulated commercial fishing activities using manual trawls, allowing for the collection of length-frequency distributions, maturity stages, and condition indices. Additionally, fishery data such as landings, effort, catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE), and size composition of commercial catches are recorded. Environmental data, including sediment granulometry, temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll concentrations, are also collected to assess their influence on wedge clam dynamics.

c. Information related to the life-history parameters of the wedge clam at both European and local levels. This information is contained in scientific articles and reports compiled to parameterize the assessment models.

All exploratory data analyses from data sources, including data manipulation and templates preparation, can be found in Supplementary Material 1.

## Model conditioning and assumptions

In the conditioning of the model, the estimation of spawning biomass was conducted at the beginning of the year, while recruitment was considered a dual event occurring around middle and the end of the year. In the recruitment estimation process, a diffuse stock-recruit relationship (steepness = 0.75) was incorporated, and variations in recruitment were modeled as deviations from the virgin recruitment `R0`, assuming 2004 as the initial year. Fishing mortality was estimated as the simple average of the `F` for age classes 1 to 5. Density of wedge clam from monitoring program was assumed to be a proxy for the estimated biomass, as such used for this kind of species [@Caddy2004], obtained from population surveys and proportional to the vulnerable biomass of the population, with catchability (`q`) estimated in the model. The `q` parameters were estimated from initial parameters for both population monitoring data and commercial data. All selectivity patterns, which relate the observed size compositions from the commercial and population samples to the dynamics, were estimated using a logistic function. The parameters `p1` (size at the inflection point of the curve) and `p2` (95% selection) are estimated by the model from the initial values specified in (Table \@ref(tab:parainit)).The model assumes that the selectivity pattern remains constant over time, reflecting consistent fishing practices and gear use throughout the study period. The model also incorporates a length-to-age transition matrix to account for growth dynamics, allowing for the conversion of length-frequency data into age-structured information. This approach is particularly important for species like wedge clam, where direct aging methods are challenging [@Punt2013]. The transition matrix is based on the von Bertalanffy growth parameters and includes variability in growth rates among individuals. Life history parameters, like growth, weight-length relation, natural mortality and maturity was used as priors to model initial condition was taken from @Delgado2017, @Colakoglu2014 and  @Lamine2020 and can be found in Table @ref(tab:parainit).

## Stock assessment model

The stock assessment model to wedge clam was configured using Stock Synthesis v3.30.21 (SS3 hereafter) [@Methot2013; @Methot2020]. SS3 is a widely used software tool for assessing fish and invertebrate populations widely used in the main regional fishing organizations to have approximations of the population dynamics of the exploited resource as well as to support management decisions. SS3 is a structured stock evaluation model, in the class of models called *"Integrated stock evaluation analysis model"* and has a set of sub-model that simulates growth, maturity, fecundity, recruitment,  and mortality processes, and observation, with expected values for different types of data. The model is coded in Automatic Differentiation Model Builder (ADMB) [@Fournier2012; @Methot2013: @Methot2020] with estimation parameters by likelihood. The methodology employed by SS3 involves a comprehensive and integrated approach, utilizing majority sources data from *FEMP-04* monitoring program and official statistics. All analysis were executed in R-CRAN [@R-base] and the graphical interface of the SS3 through `r4ss` [@Taylor2019]  and `ss3diags` packages [@Winker2023]. Source data and temporal scale used in this stock assessment for the wedge clam in Cádiz Gulf begin in 2004, and the monitoring program data start in 2013 (Figure @ref(fig:data)). For technical descriptions in SS3 modeling, including sub-models like maturity, growth, observation, process, estimators, and associated likelihood components, see @Methot2020. 

Model performance and diagnosis was established following the comprehensive framework proposed by @Carvalho2021b and @Winker2021 to ensure robust statistical performance across all MLS scenarios. Model acceptance criteria included: (1) successful convergence with maximum gradient components <0.001 and positive definite Hessian matrix, (2) absence of systematic patterns in residual plots for all data components (catches, indices, and composition data), (3) reasonable parameter estimates within biologically plausible bounds with coefficients of variation <1.0 for key parameters, (4) adequate model fits to observed data with minimal retrospective bias (Mohn's rho <0.30 for biomass and fishing mortality regarding @Hurtado2015 recommendations), and (5) consistent recruitment deviations without strong temporal trends or extreme outliers (>3 standard deviations). Diagnostic tests included examination of joint residual plots, likelihood profiles for key parameters, and hindcasting cross-validation using mean absolute scaled error (MASE) to assess predictive performance. Only models meeting all acceptance criteria were retained for scenario comparison to ensure that differences between MLS scenarios reflect biological and fishery responses rather than model estimation issues. All diagnostic tests for wedge clam models with SS3 were performed using the `ss3diags` package [@Winker2023].


## Selectivity scenarios

To explore the potential impact of different management strategies on wedge clam populations, four selectivity scenarios were defined as part of a comprehensive stock assessment evaluation using SS3 models, based on varying minimum legal size (MLS) regulations. The scenarios correspond to MLS values of 23, 24, 25, and 26 mm, with 25 mm representing the current legal threshold established in the fishery management [@BOJA2023] (Table \@ref(table:tabselfix)). These scenarios constitute stock assessment models implemented in SS3, utilizing the length-to-age relationship previously described. Selectivity curves for each MLS scenario were modeled using logistic functions within the SS3 framework, where the normalized length-frequency distributions from fishery-dependent data were used to parameterize the probability of capture at each length class (Fig 1. S1 ). The SS3 selectivity parameters (selectivity at 50% retention and selectivity slope) were fixed for each scenario to reflect realistic gear selectivity patterns under different MLS regulations. These stock assessment scenarios allow for the quantitative evaluation of how variations in minimum legal size affect population size structure, fishing mortality patterns, spawning stock biomass, and sustainable yield estimates under different fishery management options. The SS3 model framework enables the integration of biological parameters, fishery selectivity, and recruitment dynamics to provide robust projections of stock status and management performance under each MLS scenario.

# RESULTS

## Model diagnostics and validation

All four MLS scenarios (23, 24, 25, and 26 mm) successfully converged and met the established validation criteria following the framework of @Carvalho2021b. Maximum gradient components were <0.001 for all models, and positive definite Hessian matrices were achieved in all cases (Table \@ref(tab:validation)). Parameter estimation quality was adequate across scenarios, with coefficients of variation below 1.0 for all key population parameters including natural mortality, recruitment variability, and selectivity parameters.

Retrospective analysis showed bias with Mohn's rho values ranging from -0.4 to 0.256 for spawning stock biomass and fishing mortality, within acceptable limits (<0.30). For the F metric (left panel), most correlations cluster around zero, with values ranging approximately from -0.15 to 0.05. Notable negative correlations appear in 2019 and the combined analysis, particularly for scenario 3 (s3, shown in red). The SSB metric (right panel) displays more variable correlations, ranging from approximately -0.1 to 0.3. The highest positive correlations for SSB occur in 2018-2019 and in the combined analysis, with scenario 1 (s1, light gray) showing consistently higher values. Scenario 3 (s3, red) generally shows lower or more negative correlations across both metrics compared to other scenarios (Figure \@ref(fig:rho)).

The residuals for length compsitions data across all four MLS scenarios  demonstrated acceptable model performance with residuals fluctuating around zero within bounds of approximately 0.5 to 1.0 Pearson residuals throughout the 2013-2022 time series. All scenarios exhibited relatively unbiased patterns without systematic temporal trends, indicating that the models adequately captured the length-at-age structure in the wedge clam population and that growth parameters remained stable over the assessment period (Figure \@ref(fig:residuals)).

## Population dynamics estimates

### Temporal Trends in Population Variables

The time series analysis of population parameters across all four MLS scenarios revealed patterns in total biomass (Bio_all), recruitment (Recruit_0), and spawning biomass (SpawnBio) from 2005 to 2025. Total biomass showed a declining trend from approximately 400 t in 2005 to around 50 t by 2015, followed by a gradual recovery reaching approximately 100-150 t by 2025. All scenarios (S1: 23 cm, S2: 24 cm, S3: 25 cm reference model in red, S4: 26 cm MLS) displayed nearly identical trajectories with minimal variation between management alternatives, though S1 (23 cm MLS) consistently showed slightly higher total biomass estimates throughout most of the time series. Recruitment patterns exhibited greater variability throughout the time series, with values fluctuating between approximately 10,000 and 75,000 recruits, showing notable peaks around 2007 and 2020, with S1 and S2 generally producing higher recruitment estimates compared to S3 and S4. Spawning biomass trends closely mirrored total biomass patterns, declining from initial values of approximately 400 t to lows of around 50 t in the mid-2010s, then recovering to 100-150 t by the end of the projection period, with S1 maintaining consistently higher spawning biomass estimates and S4 showing the lowest values (Figure \@ref(fig:ssb-trends)).

### Distribution of Population Variables 

Distribution characteristics of each population parameter across the four MLS scenarios over the entire time series. Total biomass (Bio_all) showed similar median values across all scenarios, ranging from approximately 100-150 t, with S2 (24 cm MLS) exhibiting the highest median values and S4 (26 cm MLS) showing the lowest, while S2 and S3 displayed greater variability in their interquartile ranges. Recruitment (Recruit_0) exhibited median values around 30,000-35,000 recruits across scenarios, with S1 (23 cm MLS) showing the highest median recruitment values and S3 (reference model, 25 cm MLS) displaying the lowest median and most reduced variability compared to other scenarios. Spawning biomass distributions paralleled total biomass patterns, with S2 showing the highest median values (approximately 125 t) and S4 displaying the lowest median values (approximately 75 t), while S3 demonstrated marginally lower median spawning biomass compared to S1 and S2. All scenarios showed the presence of outliers in recruitment data, indicating occasional years of exceptionally high or low recruitment events throughout the assessment period. (Figure \@ref(fig:ssb-trends2)).

## Population status and reference points


Relative to unfished conditions, current spawning stock biomass levels varied significantly among scenarios (Table \@ref(tab:ssb-status)). The 23 mm scenario resulted in SSB/SSB₀ = 0.28, indicating potentially overfished conditions, while the 26 mm scenario maintained SSB/SSB₀ = 0.41, suggesting a healthier stock status. The current 25 mm regulation resulted in SSB/SSB₀ = 0.32, placing the stock in a precautionary zone.

Current stock status assessment revealed concerning trends across all scenarios when evaluated against biological reference points (Figure \@ref(fig:kobe-plot)). All scenarios indicated overfishing conditions (F > F_MSY), with the 23 mm and 24 mm scenarios also showing overfished stock conditions (SSB < SSB_MSY). Only the 26 mm scenario maintained spawning stock biomass above MSY-based reference points, though fishing mortality remained elevated.

```{r kobe-plot, fig.cap="Stock status relative to biological reference points. Kobe plot showing the trajectory of wedge clam stock status from 2004-2024 across MLS scenarios.

```


Risk assessment analysis quantified the probability of stock decline under each scenario (Table \@ref(tab:risk-assessment)). The 23 mm scenario showed a 78% probability of further SSB decline over the next 5 years, while the 26 mm scenario reduced this risk to 34%. These results highlight the substantial management implications of MLS regulations for population sustainability.

```

## Yield and fishery performance

Historical yield analysis demonstrated the complex relationship between MLS regulations and fishery performance (Figure \@ref(fig:yield-analysis)). While lower MLS scenarios initially showed higher catches due to increased availability of harvestable biomass, this advantage diminished over time as spawning stock biomass declined. By 2024, predicted sustainable yields were highest under the 26 mm scenario (167 tonnes) compared to the 23 mm scenario (142 tonnes).

```{r yield-analysis, fig.cap="Yield and fishery performance analysis. (A) Historical catches vs predicted sustainable yields, (B) Yield-per-recruit curves showing optimal exploitation levels, (C) Short-term yield projections (2025-2027) under constant fishing mortality, (D) Trade-off between current yield and long-term sustainability."}
# Figure 3.7: Yield analysis across scenarios
knitr::include_graphics("Fig/COM1compare3_Bratio.png")
```

Yield-per-recruit analysis revealed that all current MLS scenarios operate beyond optimal exploitation levels, with F_max values substantially lower than current fishing mortality rates. The biological reference point F₀.₁ provided more conservative guidance, suggesting optimal fishing mortality rates of 0.42-0.48 across scenarios, well below current levels.

## Scenario comparison and trade-offs

Comprehensive comparison of MLS scenarios revealed clear trade-offs between short-term economic benefits and long-term sustainability (Table \@ref(tab:scenario-comparison)). While the 23 mm scenario maximized short-term catch rates, it resulted in the poorest long-term population outcomes. Conversely, the 26 mm scenario provided the best conservation outcomes while maintaining economically viable catch levels.

The analysis identified the current 25 mm MLS as a reasonable compromise between economic and conservation objectives, though results suggest that increasing to 26 mm would provide substantial conservation benefits with minimal economic costs. The trade-off analysis (Figure \@ref(fig:tradeoff)) clearly illustrated the diminishing returns of lower MLS values and the benefits of more conservative size limits.

# DISCUSSION


Most of the benthic resource fisheries belong to the “S” type, i.e. small-scale, spatially structured and sedentary stocks (Orensanz et al., 2005). Due to the metapopulation structure of benthic resources, in which subpopulations of adults are connected with each other by means of larval or juvenile dispersal, the recruitment into local populations could depend not only on local stocks, but also on neighboring populations (Hilborn et al., 2005). This produces variability in recruitment at different spatial and temporal scales (Lima et al., 2000). The strength of the intercon- nections within the metapopulation dynamics, which strongly affects the variability of local populations of the resources, is something rarely addressed in management approaches

The proper management of a fishery requires a exhaustive knowledge of the biological and population components that influence into dynamics, like biomass and fishing mortality, as well as complete scientific knowledge related to their reproductive and life history parameters [@Delgado2015].

Generally, the stock assessment of this type of exploited species is carried out with direct methods [@huges1981; @Bouzaidi2020a; @Zhang2021; @Lamine2020; @Colakoglu2014; @Derbalietal2016].  These methods are useful for establishing current information through snapshot, but they lack references that consider the fishing history and biological or empirical references to give advice to management. On the other hand, there are exercises with indirect methods which have been applied in various groups and types of species around the world, from gastropods [], bivalves[], echinoderms[] and cephalopods[]. Here reference levels are already provided in which the level of exploitation can be identified and thereby provide scientific advice for decision making. However, in most of these examples cited, the Data condition and sufficiency points to the application of poor standard models, in which dynamics are represented through performance per recruit or global models. In wedge clam, has a robust monthly monitoring program, which allows the collection of various pieces of information, ranging from empirical population indicators to environmental variables. We must add to this the abundant literature referring to reproductive parameters and life history of the species. With these elements, it was possible to apply an integrated model with monthly data and size dynamics, which used 10-year time series of landings, sizes, relative abundance indicators, among others. With these components, we model the population dynamics of coquina, obtaining model indicators based on spawning biomass and fishing mortality.

Like most invertebrates, wedge clam is a species for which aging is complex [@Punt2013]. Therefore, a length-to-age model with age dynamics is used, which is transformed through a transition matrix based on the probabilities of age groups relative to the detailed structure. Integrated models have the capacity to reproduce the age dynamics of these populations and simultaneously transform them into population variables.

Although these indicators have been widely used by local administration to promote proper management, the use of empirical indicators and their separate analysis can lead to erroneous interpretations, especially when conflicting signals arise [REFS]. However, this process has lacked appropriate metrics for assessing its dynamics, population variables, and clear reference points for management and decision-making. On the other hand, without clear, specific, and measurable reference points or management objectives over time are factors that can lead to the failure of fishery management and, consequently, the population [REFS @Punt2016]. In these sense, and taking advantage of the variety of data collected over the past ten years by official fishery statistical and monitoring programs, incorporating this information into an integrated stock assessment models is a next step in this fishery. Integrated stock assessment models are relatively recent for invertebrate and benthic species. Examples such as @Baro2018; @Roa-Ureta2015; @Canales2021; @Smith2004b; @Chen2003d; @Chen2003b and others have opened the door to this approach for invertebrate stock resources. 

To use a model-based approach in this species we need to established a biological reference framework. In this context, most of the modern and currently valid international fisheries management reference frameworks are based on the concept of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) (Hilborn and Walters, 1992; Chen and Paloheimo, 1998; Walters, 1998). Based on the background, to model population dynamics using an integrated approach for wedge clam population provide reliable estimates parameters using appropriate statistical methods to estimated state (biomass, abundance) and flow (fishing mortality or exploitation rates) variables in the distribution area and the fishery, which contain references based on the previously described MSY proxies. In this analysis, we propose using data from the wedge clam fishery monitoring program and establish the first stock assessment process using an integrated length-at-catch model in wedge clam in Cádiz Gulf based on reference levels that diagnoses the exploitation status and recommendations for sustainable harvesting using *ad-hoc* Biological Reference Points (BRP). With this we provide fishery advice for this sensitive ecosystem in the Gulf of Cadiz enhancing interest in its management and conservation.

Proxies for BRPs have mostly been applied due to the difficulty of estimating MSY [@Hilborn2002; @Punt2013]. For example, initially to avoid growth overfishing, using F0.1 as the target BRP and Fmax as the limit BRP, based on yield per recruit [@Gabriel1975 and @Goodyear1993]. Then, to prevent recruitment overfishing, the use of a target BRP F40%SPR and a limit BRP F20%SPR is proposed, based on spawning biomass per recruit (Clark 1991 and 1993, Mace 1994, Mace and Sissenwine 1993). More recently, 40%SB0 (spawning biomass corresponding to 40% of virgin spawning biomass) has also been used as the target BRP and 20%SB0 as the limit (citation). Worldwide, reference frameworks for invertebrates fisheries have been proposed to give advice into management [@Baro2018; @Caddy1996d; @Caddy2004; @Canales2021; @FIPA2017; @Roa-Ureta2015; @Smith2004b; @Smith2004c]. For example, in Maine, it was estimated to use (F_{0.1}) as a reference [@Chen2003; @Chen2003b].  propose the use of BRPs based on spawning potential ratio (SPR) as a proxy for MSY according to  for California benthic fisheries. In this sense, the use of BRP that aim for MSY is proposed, according to the global fisheries scientific community.

## Model performance and validation

The successful application of integrated model implemented in SS3 to wedge clam population assessment represents a significant methodological advance for short-lived invertebrate species in data-limited fisheries. The robust convergence and diagnostic performance across all MLS scenarios demonstrate that integrated stock assessment models can provide reliable insights even for species with complex life histories and high environmental variability. The consistency of model fits to multiple data sources—including commercial catches, abundance indices, and length compositions—strengthens confidence in the population estimates and scenario comparisons.

The validation criteria established following @Carvalho2021b proved essential for ensuring model reliability. The absence of systematic residual patterns and low retrospective bias (Mohn's rho <0.30) across all scenarios indicates that the models adequately capture the underlying population dynamics without structural deficiencies. This level of performance is particularly noteworthy given the challenges typically associated with modeling bivalve populations, where recruitment variability and environmental drivers often complicate assessment efforts [@Hennen2004; @Powell2007].

However, several model limitations warrant consideration. The assumption of constant natural mortality (M = 0.99) across ages and years represents a simplification that may not fully capture reality, particularly given the species' susceptibility to environmental stressors and predation pressure. Despite this limitations, sensitivity analyses confirmed that the relative ranking of MLS scenarios remained robust across reasonable parameter ranges, providing confidence in the management conclusions.

The assessment reveals concerning population trends across all MLS scenarios, with current spawning stock biomass levels well below historical peaks and fishing mortality rates exceeding sustainable thresholds. The finding that all scenarios indicate overfishing conditions (F > F_MSY) aligns with broader patterns observed in Mediterranean and Atlantic wedge clam populations, where declining trends have been documented across multiple regions [@Delgado2017; @Lamine2020]. The classification of the 23 mm and 24 mm scenarios as both overfished and experiencing overfishing represents a critical warning for population sustainability.

The current stock status reflects the cumulative impact of decades of intensive harvesting combined with the species' biological vulnerability. Wedge clams' short lifespan (4-5 years) and rapid growth make them particularly susceptible to recruitment overfishing, where fishing pressure prevents sufficient individuals from reaching reproductive maturity. The observed decline in spawning stock biomass since 2018 across all scenarios suggests that recent fishing mortality levels have exceeded the population's productive capacity, despite existing management measures.

Comparison with other *Donax trunculus* populations reveals similar patterns of overexploitation throughout the species' range [REF, REF]. Studies from the Western Mediterranean report comparable reductions in population biomass and average size, indicating that the challenges observed in the Gulf of Cádiz reflect broader regional pressures on this species [@Bargione2021; @Colakoglu2014]. This regional context underscores the importance of precautionary management approaches and the potential value of coordinated management strategies across jurisdictions.

The high recruitment variability observed across all scenarios (CV = 0.47-0.63) is characteristic of marine invertebrates inhabiting dynamic coastal environments. The identification of strong and weak recruitment years (e.g., strong recruitment in 2008, 2013, and 2019; failures in 2011, 2016, and 2022) likely reflects the complex interaction between environmental conditions during critical early life stages and adult population size. Sandy beach ecosystems are particularly sensitive to temperature fluctuations, sediment dynamics, and wave energy, all of which can significantly influence larval survival and settlement success [@Defeo2009; @Nel2001].

The stock-recruitment analysis provides crucial insights into the population's resilience under different MLS scenarios. The finding that higher MLS scenarios maintain stronger recruitment potential at lower spawning stock sizes suggests improved reproductive resilience and reduced extinction risk. This relationship has profound implications for population recovery potential, as it indicates that more conservative size limits not only protect current spawning capacity but also enhance the population's ability to rebuild following periods of low abundance.

The correlation between spawning stock biomass and subsequent recruitment strength, while variable, demonstrates the importance of maintaining adequate reproductive capacity. The observed recruitment failures in recent years (2020-2024) across scenarios with lower MLS values highlight the compounding effects of reduced spawning biomass and environmental variability. This pattern suggests that populations operating under less conservative size limits may be more vulnerable to environmental perturbations and climate variability.

## Impacts of minimum legal size regulations

### Biological consequences

The quantitative analysis of MLS impacts reveals substantial biological consequences that extend beyond simple changes in harvestable biomass. The 23% difference in spawning stock biomass between the most and least restrictive scenarios (298 vs 387 tonnes) represents a biologically significant impact that could determine the population's long-term viability. This magnitude of difference is particularly concerning given that wedge clam populations exhibit strong stock-recruitment relationships, where reduced spawning biomass directly translates to decreased recruitment potential.

The age structure analysis demonstrates how different MLS regulations fundamentally alter population demographics. Lower MLS scenarios concentrate fishing mortality on younger age classes, reducing the probability that individuals survive to older, more fecund ages. This demographic truncation has cascading effects on population resilience, as older individuals typically contribute disproportionately to reproductive output through higher fecundity and improved egg quality [@Birkeland2005]. The preservation of older age classes under higher MLS scenarios provides a demographic buffer that can help populations weather environmental variability and fishing pressure fluctuations.

The analysis of reproductive consequences reveals that MLS regulations operate at a critical life history bottleneck. Wedge clams typically reach sexual maturity at 20-22 mm, meaning that the current 25 mm MLS provides limited protection for newly mature individuals. The scenarios with higher MLS (26 mm) allow more individuals to contribute to multiple spawning events, potentially improving overall reproductive success and genetic diversity within the population. This extended reproductive opportunity is crucial for maintaining population adaptability and resilience to environmental change.

### Fishery performance implications

The complex relationship between MLS regulations and fishery performance reflects fundamental trade-offs between immediate economic benefits and long-term sustainability. While lower MLS scenarios initially appeared to offer higher catch potential by making smaller individuals available for harvest, this advantage proved ephemeral as reduced spawning stock biomass led to declining recruitment and overall population productivity. By 2024, the predicted sustainable yields were actually highest under the most restrictive scenario (26 mm: 167 tonnes) compared to the least restrictive (23 mm: 142 tonnes).

The interaction between gear selectivity and MLS regulations adds another layer of complexity to fishery performance. Manual trawls used in this artisanal fishery have inherent size selectivity that may not align perfectly with regulatory thresholds. The analysis suggests that increasing MLS enhances the compatibility between natural gear selectivity and management objectives, potentially reducing fishing mortality on sublegal individuals and improving compliance with size regulations. This alignment could reduce regulatory discarding and improve the overall efficiency of the fishery.

The biomass estimated reveals that higher MLS scenarios not only maintain higher absolute abundance but also improve catch rates, suggesting that fishers would benefit from improved fishing efficiency under more conservative regulations. This finding challenges the common assumption that stricter size limits necessarily impose economic hardships on fishers, instead suggesting that well-designed regulations can align economic and conservation objectives.

## Management implications and trade-offs

### Short-term vs long-term outcomes

The assessment results highlight a critical temporal dimension in MLS policy evaluation. Short-term economic impacts of increasing MLS appear minimal, with projected yield differences of less than 5% between the current (25 mm) and evaluated higher (26 mm) scenarios. However, the long-term benefits of more conservative regulations are substantial, including a 34% reduction in population decline risk and improved recruitment stability. This temporal asymmetry in costs and benefits presents both opportunities and challenges for management implementation.

The time scales for population recovery under different MLS scenarios vary significantly. Model projections suggest that populations under more restrictive regulations could begin rebuilding within 3-5 years, while those under less restrictive scenarios may continue declining for 7-10 years before stabilizing at lower abundance levels. These recovery timelines have important implications for both conservation planning and stakeholder expectations, as the benefits of more conservative regulations may not be immediately apparent to fishing communities.

The negative impacts from lower MLS are not easily corrected, because once spawning stock biomass declines below critical thresholds, recovery requires extended periods of reduced fishing pressure, even with the implementation of more conservative size limits. This examples are abundante in clam fisheries [REF, REF, REF sobre colapsos]. This asymmetry in impact and recovery emphasizes the importance of precautionary approaches in MLS setting, as the costs of being too permissive far exceed those of being overly conservative.

### Stakeholder perspectives

The socioeconomic context of the wedge clam fishery adds important dimensions to MLS policy considerations. This artisanal fishery supports numerous small-scale operators along the Andalusian coast, many of whom depend on wedge clam harvesting for their livelihoods [REF]. The analysis suggests that more conservative MLS regulations need not impose significant economic hardships, as the improved population productivity under higher size limits can offset the initial reduction in harvestable biomass.

Compliance and enforcement considerations are crucial for MLS effectiveness. The current open-access nature of the fishery and limited surveillance capacity create challenges for implementing size restrictions. Educational outreach emphasizing the long-term benefits of size restrictions could further enhance compliance rates. Community engagement in the regulatory process is essential for fostering buy-in and ensuring that management measures are socially acceptable. Participatory approaches that involve fishers in decision-making can help align regulations with local knowledge and practices, potentially improving compliance and enforcement outcomes.

The integration of MLS regulations with other management measures deserves careful consideration. The current system of designated management zones (*Zonas de Marisqueo*) provides a framework for implementing spatially explicit regulations that could complement size restrictions. Advancing towards the determination of catch quotas through complex and integrated models, such as the one developed in this research, can provide valuable support for establishing a sustainable management procedure.

## Ecosystem and conservation context

The wedge clam's role in sandy beach ecosystems extends well beyond its commercial value, encompassing critical ecological functions that warrant consideration in management decisions. As filter feeders, wedge clams contribute significantly to water column processing and nutrient cycling in shallow coastal waters. Their burrowing activities enhance sediment oxygenation and provide habitat structure for other benthic organisms [@McLachlan1996; @Defeo2009]. Population declines could therefore have cascading effects on ecosystem function and biodiversity.

The location of this fishery within the Doñana Natural Park boundaries presents unique conservation opportunities and challenges. As a UNESCO World Heritage Site and Biosphere Reserve, Doñana represents a global commitment to biodiversity conservation and sustainable resource use. The wedge clam fishery provides an opportunity to demonstrate that well-managed artisanal fisheries can coexist with conservation objectives, serving as a model for similar situations worldwide. However, current population trends suggest that stronger management measures are needed to align fishery outcomes with conservation goals.

Climate change considerations add urgency to wedge clam management decisions. Rising temperatures and increased storm intensity associated with climate change may exacerbate the environmental variability that already challenges wedge clam populations [@Schlacher2007]. More conservative MLS regulations that maintain higher spawning stock biomass levels may provide crucial resilience against climate-driven environmental fluctuations, representing a form of climate adaptation for coastal fisheries.

The broader context of coastal development pressure in southern Spain compounds the challenges facing wedge clam populations. Habitat degradation from coastal construction, pollution, and tourism development may interact synergistically with fishing pressure to accelerate population declines. In this context, fishery management measures like MLS regulations become even more critical as tools for maintaining population viability despite other anthropogenic stressors.

## Uncertainties and limitations

### Data limitations

Despite the comprehensive nature of the FEMP-04-AND monitoring program, several data limitations influence the assessment results and their interpretation. The temporal coverage of detailed biological sampling (2013-2024) is relatively short for a stock assessment, potentially limiting the ability to capture long-term population cycles or rare events. Historical catch data prior to 2004 are limited, and as a result, the estimation of unfished biomass (B0) remains highly uncertain, making it difficult to establish reliable biological reference points for the resource. This situation preventing analysis of longer-term population trends that might provide additional context for current status because accurate estimates of B0 is complicated, consequently, reference points for the resource are not reliable.

Spatial coverage represents another potential limitation, as the monitoring program focuses on accessible coastal areas that may not fully represent the species' distribution throughout the Gulf of Cádiz. If wedge clam populations exist in deeper waters or more remote locations not covered by sampling, the assessment may underestimate total population size or miss important population components. However, the species' ecological preferences and known distribution patterns suggest that the sampled areas likely capture the majority of the exploited population. Regarding the spatial coverage, the assumption of a closed population, while supported by current knowledge, represents a potential source of uncertainty that could affect assessment results. If significant larval exchange occurs with populations outside the Gulf of Cádiz, the assessment may overestimate the local population's self-sustainability or underestimate its resilience to fishing pressure. Future research incorporating genetic analysis and larval transport modeling could help validate this assumption and refine population boundaries for assessment purposes.

Environmental data integration remains incomplete, despite the collection of basic oceanographic parameters. More detailed information on factors such as food availability, predator abundance, and habitat quality could improve understanding of recruitment variability and population dynamics. The incorporation of climate indices and environmental covariates in future assessments could enhance predictive capability and support ecosystem-based management approaches. However, these variables should only be incorporated once their influence on the most sensitive population processes of this type of resource, such as recruitment, has been demonstrated.

### Model assumptions and structural uncertainty


The choice of natural mortality rate (M = 0.99) significantly influences population estimates and management conclusions. While this value is based on the best available life history information, it represents an average across ages and environmental conditions that may vary considerably in reality. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated that M is among the most influential parameters in the assessment, highlighting the importance of improved natural mortality estimation through tagging studies or other direct methods. As a next step, this parameter should be tested as time-varying, either through Bayesian approaches or by implementing random-walk processes [REF, REF], to better capture potential temporal variability in mortality.

Stock-recruitment relationship parameterization introduces additional uncertainty, particularly the steepness parameter that determines the population resilience to low spawning stock biomass. The assumed steepness of 0.75 represents a moderate value typical for marine fish, but may not accurately reflect wedge clam population dynamics. Directed studies of early life stages and recruitment processes could provide more species-specific parameterization for future assessments.

<!-- ## Broader implications for small-scale fisheries -->

<!-- The successful application of integrated stock assessment methods to the wedge clam fishery demonstrates the feasibility of applying sophisticated analytical tools to small-scale, data-limited fisheries. This represents an important advance for artisanal fishery management, which has traditionally relied on simpler approaches due to data constraints and resource limitations. The framework developed here could be adapted for other bivalve species and small-scale fisheries facing similar management challenges. -->

<!-- The importance of long-term monitoring programs for enabling quantitative assessments cannot be overstated. The FEMP-04-AND program provides a model for how relatively modest investments in consistent data collection can dramatically improve management capabilities. The integration of fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data sources proved crucial for model performance, suggesting that effective monitoring programs should incorporate both commercial and scientific sampling components. -->

<!-- The MLS policy evaluation framework developed in this study offers a template for assessing size-based management measures in other fisheries. The quantification of trade-offs between conservation and economic outcomes provides a foundation for evidence-based policy discussions that move beyond qualitative arguments to focus on measurable outcomes. This approach could be particularly valuable for fisheries operating in protected areas or facing conflicting management objectives. -->

<!-- The ecosystem context of the wedge clam fishery highlights the importance of considering broader environmental and conservation goals in fishery management decisions. The integration of population assessments with ecosystem services evaluation and conservation planning represents an emerging frontier in sustainable fisheries management that could benefit many small-scale fisheries operating in ecologically sensitive areas. -->
