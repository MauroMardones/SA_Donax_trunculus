# ABSTRACT

This study evaluates the implications of different minimum legal harvest sizes on the population dynamics and management outcomes of the wedge clam (*Donax trunculus*) fishery in the Gulf of Cádiz. Using an integrated length-to-age stock assessment model, we analyze five selectivity scenarios based on minimum legal sizes: 26 mm, 25 mm (current regulation), 24 mm, 23 mm and 22 mm. The objective is to assess how variations in legal size thresholds affect estimates of recruitment, total biomass, and spawning stock biomass, and to determine the potential consequences for the sustainability of the fishery. Each scenario is modeled under consistent structural assumptions and data inputs, allowing for meaningful comparison across population metrics. Model inputs are derived from a robust, ongoing monitoring program for wedge clam, which includes monthly data on population structure, fishery effort and landings, and environmental variables. This comprehensive dataset strengthens the model’s ability to reflect realistic biological and fishery conditions. Results show that depletion levels relative to virgin biomass in last year (2023) increased as the minimum legal size rose: 38% of individuals are below the MLS in s0 (22 mm), 40% in s1 (23 mm), 50% in s2 (24 mm), 55% in s3 (25 mm), and 61% in s4 (26 mm). These values remain above the 20% depletion threshold proposed as a limit reference point, but the upward trend with increasing size limits demonstrates that larger minimum sizes preserve higher levels of spawning biomass and improve stock resilience. Findings suggest that reducing the minimum legal size may temporarily increase short-term yields but would lead to lower spawning stock biomass and higher risk of overexploitation. We therefore recommend maintaining the current regulation of 25 mm to balance harvest opportunities with biological sustainability. More broadly, this work underscores the value of integrated, model-based approaches to provide reliable estimates of population variables and stock status, thereby supporting sustainable management of this fishery.

# INTRODUCTION

The wedge clam (*Donax trunculus*) is a key species in sandy beach ecosystems of southern Europe and the Mediterranean, where it plays both ecological and socio-economic roles [@McLachlanetal1995; @Bargione2021; @Delgado2017; @Gray2016]. Along the Andalusian coast of southern Spain, this bivalve represents one of the most valuable resources for artisanal fisheries, sustaining local livelihoods and contributing significantly to coastal economies [@Schlacher2014; @Defeo2009; @Delgado2017]. The species' ecological importance extends beyond its commercial value, as it serves as a critical component of sandy beach food webs and contributes to nutrient cycling and sediment dynamics in these dynamic environments [@Defeo2009; @Schlacher2008; @Schlacher2014; @Short1991]

The wedge clam fishery exemplifies the challenges facing small-scale artisanal and invertebrate fisheries worldwide. Over the past three decades, this fishery has experienced growing pressure from increased coastal exploitation, urban development, and intensified fishing effort in European coasts [@Baeta2023; @Baeta2023; @Colakoglu2020; @Lamine2020]. The fishery's open-access nature (characterized by low entry barriers, strong economic incentives for participation, and widespread illegal harvesting under limited surveillance further) exacerbates its vulnerability to overexploitation. This fishery presents a critical management paradox: while the fishery operates within the administrative limits of the Doñana Natural Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and Biosphere Reserve [@UNESCO_Donana; @CiroRico2014] renowned for its biodiversity and ecological significance, signs of resource depletion or colapse are becoming increasingly evident like other clam population. The coexistence of an economically important artisanal fishery with conservation objectives in one of Europe's most emblematic protected areas highlights the urgent need for science-based management approaches that can balance socio-economic needs with ecosystem sustainability.

The biological characteristics of wedge clam make it particularly susceptible to overexploitation. The species exhibits rapid growth, a relatively short lifespan (4-5 years) [@Colakoglu2014; @Gaspar1999a; @Lamine2020], and high sensitivity to environmental variability, particularly temperature fluctuations and wind regimes [@CiroRico2014; @Delgado2018]. These traits, combined with its aggregated distribution patterns [@Colakoglu2014] and accessibility to harvesters, create conditions that can lead to rapid population declines if fishing pressure exceeds the population capacity for recovery. Evidence from several studies across the Pacific [@Hernandez2011], Mediterranean [@Baeta2023; @Escriva2021], North Africa [@Lamine2020] Atlantic coasts and worldwide [@Huang2023] indicates rapid declining trends in biomass and collapsed in sandy beach clams fisheries, raising concerns about the long-term sustainability of these fisheries.

Current management of the Andalusian wedge clam fishery relies primarily on input controls implemented through a system of designated management zones (Zonas de Marisqueo), outside of which harvesting is prohibited [@BOJA2023; @Marco2022]. These measures include spatial and seasonal closures, restrictions on fishing gear specifications, and most importantly, minimum legal size (MLS) regulations. The MLS serves as a fundamental tool for protecting recruitment by prohibiting the harvest of individuals below a specified size threshold, theoretically allowing clams to reach reproductive maturity and contribute to spawning stock biomass. The current MLS is set at 25 mm shell length, although the size at which 50% of individuals attain sexual maturity (L50) has been estimated at only 10.8 mm [@Delgado2018]. Moreover, although there is a substantial gap between the size at maturity and the size at selectivity imposed by the MLS, the extent to which this gap may be reduced (and its implications for population dynamics) remains poorly or not quantified.

The debate surrounding optimal MLS values for wedge clam reflects broader challenges in shellfish management. Proponents of lower size limits argue that relaxed regulations could enhance short-term yields and provide greater economic flexibility for fishers, particularly during periods of low abundance [@Colakoglu2014]. Conversely, advocates for maintaining or increasing size limits emphasize the need to protect spawning stock biomass and ensure adequate recruitment to support long-term population viability [@Defeo2009; @Schlacher2014]. This debate is further complicated by the interaction between regulatory thresholds and fishing gear selectivity, as the performance of manual trawls used in this artisanal fishery can vary substantially depending on mesh configuration and fishing technique.

The complexity of evaluating MLS effectiveness requires moving beyond simple biological considerations to embrace integrated approaches that consider population dynamics, fishery selectivity, and recruitment processes simultaneously. Stock assessment models, particularly those that integrate age-structured population dynamics with fishery selectivity patterns [REF, REF], provide the necessary analytical framework to quantify trade-offs between different management scenarios and their consequences for population and fishery sustainability. However, the application of such integrated models to wedge clam populations has been historically limited due to data constraints, the challenges associated with aging short-lived invertebrates, and the high variability characteristic of sandy beach ecosystems.

Despite the species' economic importance and the availability of monitoring data, comprehensive stock assessments for wedge clam populations remain scarce in the scientific literature. Most studies have focused on specific biological aspects such as growth parameters, reproductive cycles, or local population surveys [@Delgado2017; @Bargione2021; REF], while population-level variables such as recruitment strength, fishing mortality rates, and spawning stock biomass have been poorly characterized. This knowledge gap primarily stems from the small-scale and data-limited nature of the fishery, which has complicated the development of quantitative assessments and evidence-based management recommendations.

Advances in statistical modeling and the availability of comprehensive long-term datasets now make it possible to develop stock assessments for this ussually considered data-limited fisheries such as wedge clam [LIMA, @Hernandez2011, @Barber2019].

This study represents the first comprehensive stock assessment of *Donax trunculus* using an integrated statistical modeling approach in the Gulf of Cádiz. The specific objectives are: (1) to quantify the population-level impacts of alternative MLS scenarios, specifically evaluating whether a reduction from the current 25 mm threshold to 23 mm results in changes in spawning stock biomass, (2) to assess how changes in MLS affect fishing mortality patterns and recruitment dynamics across the four management scenarios (23, 24, 25, and 26 mm), (3) to determine the trade-offs between short-term yield increases and long-term stock sustainability under each MLS scenario, and (4) to provide quantitative management recommendations based on population reference points and risk assessment. Unlike previous studies that have focused primarily on biological parameters or local population surveys, this research integrates over a decade of comprehensive monitoring data within a robust stock assessment framework, enabling for the first time a population-scale evaluation of management alternatives for this economically important species. The findings will provide essential scientific support for evidence-based fishery management decisions in one of Europe's most significant wedge clam fishing regions, with broader implications for the sustainable management of artisanal bivalve fisheries in similar ecosystems.

# METHODOLOGY

## Study area

The study area encompasses the main wedge clam harvesting grounds along the southern coast of the Iberian Peninsula, in the Atlantic Ocean along Andalusia. This region is characterized by sandy beaches and estuarine environments, such as the Guadalquivir River estuary, which provide essential habitats for wedge clams, particularly as nursery areas for juveniles and other commercially important species. The Gulf of Cádiz is biologically rich and influenced by diverse oceanographic and climatic conditions, which shape the distribution and abundance of wedge clam populations. The Figure \@ref(fig:areaconcept) (Top panel) highlights several sampling sites distributed along the coastal zone, ranging approximately from 36.6°N to 37.4°N latitude and from 7.6°W to 6.2°W longitude. The sites are numbered (1 to 11 and M) and cover the main estuarine and coastal sectors of the region, including the mouth of the Guadalquivir River in the east and the coastal waters near Doñana and Huelva to the west. These sites are monitored monthly under a monitoring program, which systematically collects samples to evaluate population and ecological patterns in the area. Although data from all sites are available, sites 2, 4, 6, and M were selected to feed the model due to their consistency and representativeness of biological and fishery changes in the region.


## Conceptual model

A statistical modelling implemented as a stock assessment approach require special considerations regarding their biology and spatial structure arranged as a conceptual model. The conceptual model for wedge clam in Gulf of Cadiz includes an assumption about pool dynamics and closed populations, necessary assumption for this species [@Jamieson1995a]. While the wedge clam is distributed and managed across designated management zones (*Zonas de Marisqueo*), these zones should not be assumed to represent distinct population units. On the contrary, they are local populations interconnected through the larval phase with nearby local banks or populations. All these local populations have a physical limit, which in turn constitutes the boundaries of the functional population on which we base the stock assessment. The schematic diagram (Bottom panel in Figure \@ref(fig:areaconcept)) illustrates the conceptual framework of population structure: a dynamic pool composed of functional unit populations, which in turn are subdivided into local unit populations (beds or patches). 

CiroRico2014

Connectivity among these units is maintained through gametic exchange and larval dispersal, influenced by bathymetric and benthic morphology features of the beaches assuming a single, cohesive population structure and isolated population [@Marie2016; ]. Given the current knowledge of wedge clam distribution in the Gulf of Cádiz, no significant populations occur outside this area, supporting the assumption of a closed population. This framework aligns with the assumptions outlined by @Jamieson1995a, which emphasize the importance of considering both local population dynamics and broader connectivity patterns in stock assessments. Then, the main assumptions of the catch-at-length model are: a) wedge clam stock consists of several local populations that are interconnected through the drift of gametes and planktonic larvae [@DiBacco2006; @Gaynes2005; @Pineda2007], and where the impacts from fishing activities will affect the entire population as a whole, b) natural mortality is known and constant across years and ages, c) natural and fishing mortality occur simultaneously (Baranov equation), d) the vulnerability pattern of individuals is age-dependent and follows a logistic model, e) the model assumes that population are composed of no more than 4-5 age groups, f) recruitment (second year of age) results from the spawning of close patch or beds (local populations) and its survival is mainly influenced by environmental factors [@Okamoto2020] and g) the integrated model considers interannual fluctuations of growth dynamics, maturity and reproduction, with a spawning pulse per year. This framework provides the basis for evaluating stock dynamics while incorporating local population connectivity, recruitment, and habitat constraints.


## Data sources

For any stock assessment analysis, data sources are of paramount importance. To this end, a comprehensive compilation of available information was carried out from public institutions, private entities, and the scientific literature. The data analyzed as inputs for the model were classified according to their origin. Three main sources of information were identified: a) Artisanal landings from the period 2004–2024, obtained from the official statistics of [IDAPES](https://www.juntadeandalucia.es/agriculturaypesca/idapes/servlet/FrontController), associated with the shellfishing sector of Doñana Park and surrounding landings port. It should be noted that in this fishery no correction processes for landings have yet been applied. b) The primary data source for this study is the long-term monitoring program `FEMP-04-AND`, which has been conducted since 2013 by the Instituto Español de Oceanografía (IEO) in Cádiz. This program involves monthly sampling of wedge clam populations along the coast, providing comprehensive data on population structure, fishery activity, and environmental conditions. The monitoring includes both population surveys and simulated commercial fishing activities using manual trawls, allowing for the collection of length-frequency distributions, maturity stages, and condition indices. Additionally, fishery data such as landings, effort, catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE), and size composition of commercial catches are recorded. Environmental data, including sediment granulometry, temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll concentrations, are also collected to assess their influence on wedge clam dynamics. c) Information related to the life-history parameters of the wedge clam at both European and local levels. This information is contained in scientific articles and reports compiled to parameterize the assessment models. All exploratory data analyses from data sources, including data manipulation and templates preparation, can be found in Supplementary Material 1.


The FEMP-04-AND monitoring program, initiated in 2013 and funded by the European Union and Andalusian Community, has been instrumental in collecting monthly data on wedge clam populations throughout the Gulf of Cádiz. This program provides unprecedented information on population structure, fishery activity, and environmental conditions, capturing the main drivers that shape wedge clam dynamics and fishery performance over more than a decade of observations.

The ongoing monitoring program (FEMP-04-AND) initiated in 2013 by the Instituto Español de Oceanografía (IEO) in Cádiz has been instrumental in collecting monthly data on wedge clam populations throughout the Gulf of Cádiz. This program provides unprecedented information on population structure, fishery activity, and environmental conditions, capturing the main drivers that shape wedge clam dynamics and fishery performance over more than a decade of observations.

## Model conditioning and assumptions

In the conditioning of the model, the estimation of spawning biomass was conducted at the beginning of the year, while recruitment was considered a dual event occurring around middle and the end of the year. In the recruitment estimation process, a diffuse stock-recruit relationship (steepness = 0.75) was incorporated, and variations in recruitment were modeled as deviations from the virgin recruitment `R0`, assuming 2004 as the initial year. Density of wedge clam from monitoring program was assumed to be a proxy for the estimated biomass, as such used for this kind of species [@Caddy2004], obtained from population surveys and proportional to the vulnerable biomass of the population, with catchability (`q`) estimated in the model. The `q` parameters were estimated from initial parameters for both population monitoring data and commercial data. All selectivity patterns, which relate the observed size compositions from the commercial and population samples to the dynamics, were estimated using a logistic function. The parameters `p1` (size at the inflection point of the curve) and `p2` (95% selection) are estimated by the model from the initial values specified in Table 1, S1.The model assumes that the selectivity pattern remains constant over time, reflecting consistent fishing practices and gear use throughout the study period. The model also incorporates a length-to-age transition matrix to account for growth dynamics, allowing for the conversion of length-frequency data into age-structured information. This approach is particularly important for species like wedge clam, where direct aging methods are challenging [@Punt2013]. The transition matrix is based on the von Bertalanffy growth parameters and includes variability in growth rates among individuals. Life history parameters, like growth, weight-length relation, natural mortality and maturity was used as priors to model initial condition was taken from @Delgado2017, @Colakoglu2014 and @Lamine2020 and can be found in Table 1, S1.

The initial fishing mortality for the wedge clam fishery is estimated, bounded between 0.005–0.1, with a prior mean of 0.05 and a weakly informative standard deviation of 0.8. The model starts from an initial guess of 0.1 and estimates this parameter, ensuring that initial fishing pressure is informed by both empirical bounds and prior information while being integrated consistently into the early population dynamics. This approach is necessary because, although the model time series begins in 2004, the wedge clam fishery in the Gulf of Cádiz had already been operating for more than three decades, with average catches of 10–50 t. Accounting for this historical exploitation avoids unrealistically high estimates of virgin biomass that could otherwise bias the assessment of the stock’s condition.


## Stock assessment model

The stock assessment model to wedge clam was configured using Stock Synthesis v3.30.23 (SS3 hereafter) [@Methot2013; @Methot2020]. SS3 is a widely used software tool for assessing fish and invertebrate populations widely used in the main regional fishing organizations to have approximations of the population dynamics of the exploited resource as well as to support management decisions. SS3 is a structured stock evaluation model, in the class of models called *"Integrated stock evaluation analysis model"* and has a set of sub-model that simulates growth, maturity, fecundity, recruitment,  and mortality processes, and observation, with expected values for different types of data. The model is coded in Automatic Differentiation Model Builder (ADMB) [@Fournier2012; @Methot2013: @Methot2020] with estimation parameters by likelihood. The methodology employed by SS3 involves a comprehensive and integrated approach, utilizing majority sources data from *FEMP-04* monitoring program and official statistics. All analysis were executed in R-CRAN [@RCRAN2025] and the graphical interface of the SS3 through `r4ss` [@Taylor2019]. Source data and temporal scale used in this stock assessment for the wedge clam in Cádiz Gulf begin in 2004, and the monitoring program data start in 2013 (Fig 1, S1). For technical descriptions in SS3 modeling, including sub-models like maturity, growth, observation, process, estimators, and associated likelihood components, see @Methot2020. 


## Selectivity scenarios

To explore the potential impact of different management strategies on wedge clam populations, four selectivity scenarios were defined as part of a comprehensive stock assessment evaluation using SS3 models, based on varying minimum legal size (MLS) regulations. The scenarios correspond to MLS values of 23, 24, 25, and 26 mm, with 25 mm representing the current legal threshold established in the fishery management [@BOJA2023] (Table \@ref(tab:tabselfix)). These scenarios constitute stock assessment models implemented in SS3, utilizing the length-to-age relationship previously described. Selectivity curves for each MLS scenario were modeled using logistic functions within the SS3 framework, where the normalized length-frequency distributions from fishery-dependent data were used to parameterize the probability of capture at each length class (Fig 1. S1 ). The SS3 selectivity parameters (selectivity at 50% retention and selectivity slope) were fixed for each scenario to reflect realistic gear selectivity patterns under different MLS regulations. These stock assessment scenarios allow for the quantitative evaluation of how variations in minimum legal size affect population size structure, fishing mortality patterns, spawning stock biomass, and sustainable yield estimates under different fishery management options. The SS3 model framework enables the integration of biological parameters, fishery selectivity, and recruitment dynamics to provide robust projections of stock status and management performance under each MLS scenario.

Model performance and diagnosis was established following the comprehensive framework proposed by @Carvalho2021b and @Winker2025 to ensure robust statistical performance across all MLS scenarios. Model acceptance criteria included: (1) successful convergence with maximum gradient components <0.001 and positive definite Hessian matrix, (2) absence of systematic patterns in residual plots for all data components (catches, indices, and composition data), (3) adequate retrospective bias (Mohn's rho <0.30 for biomass and fishing mortality regarding @Hurtado-ferro2015 recommendations), and (4) consistent recruitment deviations without strong temporal trends or extreme outliers (>3 standard deviations). Only models meeting all acceptance criteria were retained for scenario comparison to ensure that differences between MLS scenarios reflect biological and fishery responses rather than model estimation issues. All diagnostic tests for wedge clam models with SS3 were performed using the `ss3diags` package [@Winker2023]. Statistical comparisons between MLS scenarios were conducted using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) [@Kim2017] models to formally test for significant differences in key population metrics (spawning biomass) across scenarios.

With the purpose of comparing different scenarios of resource use and their associated economic implications, we developed two ad-hoc complementary indicators: the *Economic Vulnerability Index (EVI)* and the *Risk of Population Decline (RPD)*. EVI was designed to quantify the economic return relative to the biological availability of the resource, and was calculated as $EVI_t = \frac{P_t \times C_t}{B_t}$, where $P_t$ is the referential beach price per kilogram per year, $C_t$ the annual catch (kg), and $B_t$ the estimated biomass (kg) in year $t$. This formulation reflects the economic return per unit of biomass available, and the index was subsequently normalized to its maximum value as $EVI^{*}_t = \frac{EVI_t}{\max(EVI)}$ to facilitate interannual comparisons. In parallel, the RPD was developed to measure the probability of stock depletion associated with fishing pressure, based on the exploitation rate defined as $U_t = \frac{C_t}{B_t}$. This rate was evaluated against a precautionary biological threshold, $U_{crit}=0.30$, following typical reference points for bivalve fisheries, and the risk was expressed as $RPD_t = \frac{U_t}{U_{crit}} \times 100$, where values below 100% indicate low risk of decline and values above 100% signal overexploitation. Both indices were implemented in R (v.4.3.2) using annual time series of biomass, catch, and market price from 2013 to 2024, thus providing a unified methodological framework to compare scenarios in which economic benefits are weighed against biological risks in the wedge clam fishery of the Gulf of Cádiz.

# RESULTS

## Model diagnostics and validation

All four MLS scenarios (23, 24, 25, and 26 mm) successfully converged and met the established validation criteria following the framework of @Carvalho2021b. Maximum gradient components were <0.001 for all models, and positive definite Hessian matrices were achieved in all cases. Retrospective analysis showed bias with Mohn's rho values ranging from -0.4 to 0.256 for spawning stock biomass and fishing mortality, within acceptable limits (<0.30) (Table \@ref(tab:validation)). For the F metric (left panel in Fig. 4, S1), most correlations cluster around zero, with values ranging approximately from -0.15 to 0.05. Notable negative correlations appear in 2019 and the combined analysis, particularly for scenario 3 (s3, shown in red). The SSB metric displays more variable correlations, ranging from approximately -0.1 to 0.3. 

Expected length structure presented in Figure \@ref(fig:residuals) (top panels) showing the changes in commercial fleet selectivity fixed by scenario. By holding selectivity fixed, the observed variation in length composition directly reflects changes in population structure and recruitment processes, rather than artifacts of changing fishing patterns. The consistent representation of smaller size classes across years, together with shifts in mean length (red points), suggest that the stock is persistently dominated by young cohorts. This pattern indicates limited contribution of older individuals to the fishable biomass, which is consistent with the highly exploited state of the population. Importantly, the use of a fixed selectivity assumption allows for clearer attribution of size-structure changes to biological processes such as recruitment variability and growth, thereby reinforcing the robustness of the assessment framework. These results emphasize the need to consider population-level responses beyond fishing selectivity when evaluating sustainable harvest strategies for the wedge clam fishery. The residual patterns across all scenarios demonstrate consistent behavior, with values oscillating around zero and remaining well-contained within the shaded confidence intervals throughout the temporal range. No systematic bias or temporal trends are evident in any of the four scenarios, indicating adequate model performance across the different minimum length thresholds ranging from 23 cm to 26 cm MLS, with the third scenario at 25 cm serving as the reference model (Figure \@ref(fig:residuals) (bottom panels)). 



## Population dynamics estimates

### Temporal trends and distribution in population variables

The time series analysis of population parameters across all four MLS scenarios revealed patterns in total biomass, recruitment and spawning biomass from 2005 to 2025. Total biomass showed a declining trend from approximately 400 t in 2005 to around 50 t by 2015, followed by a gradual recovery reaching approximately 100-150 t by 2023. All scenarios (S1: 23 cm, S2: 24 cm, S3: 25 cm reference model in red, S4: 26 cm MLS) displayed nearly identical trajectories with minimal variation between management alternatives, though S1 (23 cm MLS) consistently showed slightly higher total biomass estimates throughout most of the time series. Recruitment patterns exhibited greater variability throughout the time series, with values fluctuating between approximately 10,000 and 75,000 recruits, showing notable peaks around 2007 and 2020, with S1 and S2 generally producing higher recruitment estimates compared to S3 and S4. Spawning biomass trends closely mirrored total biomass patterns, declining from initial values of approximately 400 t to lows of around 50 t in the mid-2010s, then recovering to 100-150 t by the end of the projection period, with S1 maintaining consistently higher spawning biomass estimates and S4 showing the lowest values (Figure \@ref(fig:ssb-trends)).



Distribution characteristics of each population parameter across the four MLS scenarios over the entire time series. Total biomass showed similar median values across all scenarios, ranging from approximately 100-150 t, with S2 (24 cm MLS) exhibiting the highest median values and S4 (26 cm MLS) showing the lowest, while S2 and S3 displayed greater variability in their interquartile ranges. Recruitment exhibited median values around 30,000-35,000 recruits across scenarios, with S1 (23 cm MLS) showing the highest median recruitment values and S3 (reference model, 25 cm MLS) displaying the lowest median and most reduced variability compared to other scenarios. Spawning biomass distributions paralleled total biomass patterns, with S2 showing the highest median values (approximately 125 t) and S4 displaying the lowest median values (approximately 75 t), while S3 demonstrated marginally lower median spawning biomass compared to S1 and S2. All scenarios showed the presence of outliers in recruitment data, indicating occasional years of exceptionally high or low recruitment events throughout the assessment period (Figure \@ref(fig:ssbtrends2)).



The ANOVA results revealed no statistically significant differences in biomass between the four wedge clam management scenarios (F = 0.874, p = 0.352). The linear model explained only 0.8% of the variance in biomass across scenarios (R2 = 0.008), with an adjusted R-squared of -0.001, indicating that the model performs no better than a simple mean. The intercept estimate of 138.8 ± 25.5 represents the baseline biomass level, while the non-significant slope coefficient (8.68 ± 9.28, t = 0.935, p = 0.352) suggests that biomass values do not systematically increase or decrease across the four scenarios. These results suggest that the tested management scenarios produce statistically equivalent biomass outcomes for the wedge clam stock, indicating that factors other than the specific management measures tested may be driving biomass dynamics in this fishery.

### Population status and reference points

All scenarios exhibit a similar pattern of decline from initial depletion levels of approximately 0.75-0.78 in 2004-2005, reaching minimum values around 0.05-0.10 during 2013-2016. This represents a substantial depletion of the stock to less than 10% of virgin biomass levels during this period. 
Following 2016, all scenarios show recovery trajectories, with depletion levels increasing toward the end of the time series. By 2025, scenarios converge to depletion levels of approximately 0.20-0.30. The horizontal dashed line at 0.20 represents the 20% depletion threshold relative to virgin biomass, which serves as a widely accepted reference point for sustainable management and is commonly associated with the limit biomass reference point (Biomass limit). Scenarios 3 and 4 (s3 and s4) show slightly higher recovery rates in the final years, reaching depletion levels closer to or above the 20% threshold by the end of the projection period. This suggests that these management approaches may be more effective in rebuilding the stock toward sustainable levels, though all scenarios remain near or below this critical biomass reference point throughout most of the time series (Figure \@ref(fig:deple-plot)).


The results show that while increasing the minimum landing size to 26 mm raises the projected 2024 spawning biomass (+6% relative to 25 mm) and reducing it to 23 mm leads to a strong decline (−30%), in all scenarios the spawning stock biomass remains below the biological reference points, keeping the stock in an overfished condition (Table \@ref(tab:scenario-comparision))


## Scenario comparison and trade-offs

This comprehensive comparison between key population and risk metrics across four wedge clam management scenarios, revealing significant biological and management implications despite statistical non-significance. Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB) in 2024 demonstrates a clear improvement trajectory from 47.6 tons in Scenario 1 to 78.4 tons in Scenario 4, representing a 65% increase in reproductive capacity. The B/B_MSY ratios confirm overfished conditions across all scenarios, with values ranging from 0.52 to 0.82, indicating that even the most conservative management scenario (Scenario 4) maintains spawning biomass at only 82% of MSY levels. The five-year decline percentages reveal stark contrasts in recent population performance, with Scenario 1 experiencing a severe 67.6% decline compared to more moderate declines of 20-25% in Scenarios 2-4. Recruitment failure rates remain problematically high (7.4%) across most scenarios, with only Scenario 2 showing improved recruitment success (3.7%). The SSB ratio (proportion of spawning biomass to total biomass) improves from 19.6% to 27.8% across scenarios, indicating better age structure and reproductive potential under more restrictive minimum size regulations. The Economic Vulnerability Index shows peak values in Scenario 2 (0.425), suggesting this scenario may represent optimal balance between exploitation and conservation.  The risk of decline metric quantified the probability of stock decline under each scenario, and, decreasing substantially from 236 in Scenario 1 to 157 in Scenario 4, indicating that progressive increases in minimum legal size significantly reduce population collapse risk. This 33% reduction in decline risk represents the most compelling evidence for implementing more restrictive size regulations, particularly given the current overfished status of the stock across all management alternatives (Table \@ref(tab:scenario-comparison)). 


Regarding trade off analysis between population variables and economic measures, the analysis identified the current 25 mm MLS as a reasonable compromise between economic and conservation objectives, though results suggest that increasing to 26 mm would provide substantial conservation benefits with minimal economic costs. The Figure \@ref(fig:tradeoff) illustrates how increasing the minimum landing size from 23 mm to 26 mm enhances spawning stock biomass while slightly reducing economic viability, highlighting the balance between resource sustainability and fishery profitability.

# DISCUSSION

This study represents the first integrated stock assessment for *Donax trunculus* in the Gulf of Cádiz, combining multiple information sources from literature, official statistics, and a comprehensive monitoring program spanning over a decade based on FEMP 04 Project. With this apporpach, we evaluated alternative management strategies based on different minimum legal sizes (MLS) and their impacts on population dynamics, stock status, and fishery performance.

## Model performance and methodological advances

The successful application of an integrated assessment model (SS3) to wedge clam represents a significant methodological advance for invertebrate species in data-limited fisheries. Traditional stock assessments for this type of exploited species rely on direct methods or empirical indicators [@huges1981; @Bouzaidi2020a; @Zhang2021; @Lamine2020; @Colakoglu2014; @Derbalietal2016]. While these indicators are widely used by local administrations, their separate analysis can lead to erroneous interpretations, especially when conflicting signals arise. Furthermore, without clear reference points or management objectives, fishery management often fails [@Punt2016].

The robust model convergence and diagnostic performance across all MLS scenarios demonstrate that integrated stock assessment models can provide reliable insights even for species with complex life histories and high environmental variability. The validation criteria following @Carvalho2021b proved essential, with absence of systematic residual patterns and low retrospective bias (Mohn's rho <0.30) indicating adequate capture of population dynamics without structural deficiencies. This performance is particularly noteworthy given the challenges typically associated with modeling bivalve populations, where recruitment variability and environmental drivers often complicate assessment efforts [@Hennen2004; @Powell2007].

## Biological reference framework and stock status

Like most invertebrates, wedge clam is a species for which aging is complex [@Punt2013]. Therefore, a length-to-age model with age dynamics is used, which is transformed through a transition matrix based on the probabilities of age groups relative to the detailed structure [REF]. To use a model-based approach for this species, it is necessary to establish a biological reference framework. Within this background, modeling population dynamics through an integrated approach for the wedge clam allows reliable estimation of key parameters using appropriate statistical methods, providing estimates of state variables (e.g., biomass, abundance) and flow variables (e.g., fishing mortality, exploitation rates) for fishery, which can then be linked to MSY-based proxies. Proxies for BRPs have mostly been applied due to the difficulty of estimating MSY [@Hilborn2002; @Punt2013] [@Baro2018; @Caddy1996d; @Caddy2004; @Canales2021; @FIPA2017; @Roa-Ureta2015; @Smith2004b; @Smith2004c; @Chen2003; @Chen2003b]. For example, initially to avoid growth overfishing, using F0.1 as the target BRP and Fmax as the limit BRP, based on yield per recruit [@Gabriel1975 and @Goodyear1993]. Then, to prevent recruitment overfishing, the use of a target BRP F40%SPR and a limit BRP F20%SPR is proposed, based on spawning biomass per recruit (Clark 1991 and 1993, Mace 1994, Mace and Sissenwine 1993). More recently, 40%SB0 (spawning biomass corresponding to 40% of virgin spawning biomass) has also been used as the target BRP and 20%SB0 as the limit [REF].

In this study, we proposed a biological framework based on a depletion level of 20% of current spawning biomass (relative to virgin biomass or to the initial year of the historical series) as a biological reference point. This threshold is widely accepted internationally and is commonly used by Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) and government \[REF]. By adopting this level, we ensure alignment with the reference framework applied by ICES \[REF], which allows us to consistently identify and interpret the stock status of the wedge clam in the Gulf of Cádiz.

The estimated depletion levels under the four management scenarios tested were 12.8% (S1: 23 mm), 16.2% (S2: 24 mm), 17.8% (S3: 25 mm), and 19.6% (S4: 26 mm). All values remain below the 20% threshold, indicating the stock is currently above the limit reference point. However, increasing depletion levels with higher size limits suggest that more restrictive MLS could enhance long-term sustainability by maintaining larger proportions of spawning biomass.

The current stock status reflects cumulative impacts of decades of intensive harvesting combined with the species' biological vulnerability. Wedge clams' short lifespan (4-5 years) and rapid growth make them particularly susceptible to recruitment overfishing. The observed decline in spawning stock biomass since 2018 across all scenarios suggests recent fishing mortality levels have exceeded population productive capacity despite existing management measures.

## Population dynamics and recruitment patterns

The identification of strong recruitment years (2008, 2013, 2019) and failures (2011, 2016, 2021) (COVID!! Desarrollar) likely reflects complex interactions between environmental conditions during critical early life stages and adult population size. Sandy beach ecosystems are particularly sensitive to temperature fluctuations, sediment dynamics, and wave energy, all significantly influencing larval survival and settlement success [@Defeo2009; @Nel2001]. Overfished populations with reduced spawning biomass are less able to buffer against environmental variability, leading to more pronounced recruitment failures during adverse conditions.

Higher MLS scenarios maintain stronger recruitment potential at lower spawning stock sizes, suggesting improved reproductive resilience and reduced extinction risk. This relationship has profound implications for population recovery potential, indicating that more conservative size limits not only protect current spawning capacity but also enhance the population's ability to rebuild following periods of low abundance.

### Biological consequences

**REVISAR!!**

> The potential pressure arising from changes in MLS regulation can be illustrated by experiences in other European Donax trunculus fisheries. In Italy, for instance, the MLS was recently reduced to 22 mm in certain waters (2023–2025), a derogation that reflects sector demands but also raises concerns about long-term sustainability when compared to the standard 25 mm. In southern Portugal (Algarve), although the official MLS is 25 mm, more than 40% of wedge clams caught with hand dredges fall below this limit, while in Turkey (Marmara Sea) discards of individuals below MLS exceed 10% with mechanical dredges. In both cases, the vulnerability of the MLS is largely driven by economic pressures from the fishing sector seeking higher yields, which compromises sustainability. Moreover, these countries do not rely on biological reference frameworks to test or evaluate such measures—a common situation in fisheries targeting fast-growing, short-lived bivalves like Donax trunculus.


> The quantitative analysis reveals substantial biological consequences extending beyond simple changes in harvestable biomass. The 23% difference in spawning stock biomass between the most and least restrictive scenarios (104 vs 161 tonnes) represents a biologically significant impact potentially determining long-term population viability. This magnitude is particularly concerning given that wedge clam populations exhibit strong stock-recruitment relationships.

> Another good example is the Minimum Legal Size (MLS) which is not uniform in Spain. It is 25 mmm for the mechanized clam dredge fleet, while it is 21.86 mm for the hand-operated fishers in Catalonia. However, it is 25 mm in Andalusia (S Spain), 25 mm in Valencia (W Spain) and 35 mm in Galicia (NE Spain).

Different MLS regulations fundamentally alter population demographics. Lower MLS scenarios concentrate fishing mortality on younger age classes, reducing survival probability to older, more fecund ages. This demographic truncation has cascading effects on population resilience, as older individuals typically contribute disproportionately to reproductive output through higher fecundity and improved egg quality [@Birkeland2005]. Preservation of older age classes under higher MLS scenarios provides demographic buffers against environmental variability and fishing pressure fluctuations.

The analysis of reproductive consequences reveals that MLS regulations operate at a critical life history bottleneck. Wedge clams typically reach sexual maturity at 10.8 mm [@Delgado2017], meaning that the current 25 mm MLS provides a wide protection for newly mature individuals. However, the scenarios with higher MLS (26 mm) allow more individuals to contribute to multiple spawning events, potentially improving overall reproductive success and genetic diversity within the population. This extended reproductive opportunity is crucial for maintaining population adaptability and resilience to environmental change.

> Environmental, genetic, and human activities, such as fishing, can alter reproductive processes in marine species (Tobin & Wright, 2011). Traits like size at first maturity may adjust in response to exploitation or changing environments (Baeta et al., 2023, Domínguez-Petit et al., 2008; Hunter et al., 2015). A clear example is the reduction in L50 reported for an overfished *Callista chione* stock along the Catalan coast (Galimany et al., 2015).


While no statistically significant differences were detected between scenarios, population variable levels differ across management alternatives. All four scenarios indicate overfished status, whereby even minimal MLS changes have implications for stock status and fishery sustainability. Under overfished conditions, reduced population resilience means subtle management regulation variations can have disproportionate effects on recovery trajectories. This suggests statistical non-significance should not be interpreted as management equivalence when stocks operate below sustainable thresholds.

The complex relationship between MLS regulations and fishery performance reflects fundamental trade-offs between immediate economic benefits and long-term sustainability. While lower MLS scenarios initially appeared to offer higher catch potential, this advantage proved ephemeral as reduced spawning stock biomass led to declining recruitment and population productivity. By 2024, predicted sustainable yields were highest under the most restrictive scenario (26 mm: 167 tonnes) compared to the least restrictive (23 mm: 142 tonnes).

## Ecosystem considerations

Comparison with other *Donax trunculus* populations reveals similar overexploitation patterns throughout the species' range. Studies from the Western Mediterranean report comparable biomass reductions and average size decreases, indicating that challenges in the Gulf of Cádiz reflect broader regional pressures [@Bargione2021; @Colakoglu2014]. This regional context underscores the importance of precautionary management approaches and coordinated strategies across jurisdictions.

The wedge clam's role in sandy beach ecosystems extends beyond commercial value, encompassing critical ecological functions. As filter feeders, they contribute significantly to water column processing and nutrient cycling. Their burrowing activities enhance sediment oxygenation and provide habitat structure for other benthic organisms [@McLachlan1995; @Defeo2009]. Population declines could have cascading effects on ecosystem function and biodiversity.

The fishery's location within Doñana Natural Park boundaries presents unique conservation opportunities. As a UNESCO World Heritage Site and Biosphere Reserve, Doñana represents a global commitment to biodiversity conservation and sustainable resource use, providing an opportunity to demonstrate that well-managed artisanal fisheries can coexist with conservation objectives.

## Uncertainties and future research needs

### Model limitations

The choice of natural mortality rate (M = 0.99) significantly influences population estimates and management conclusions. While based on the best available life history information, it represents an average that may vary considerably across ages and environmental conditions. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated M as among the most influential parameters, highlighting the importance of improved estimation through tagging studies or other direct methods. Future assessments should test time-varying mortality through Bayesian approaches or random-walk processes.

Stock-recruitment relationship parameterization introduces additional uncertainty, particularly the steepness parameter determining population resilience to low spawning stock biomass. The assumed steepness of 0.75 may not accurately reflect wedge clam population dynamics. Directed studies of early life stages and recruitment processes could provide more species-specific parameterization.

Time constant selectivity assumptions may not fully capture the dynamic nature of fishing practices and gear efficiency [@Kinzey2019a, other REF]. Changes in fisher behavior, gear technology, and environmental conditions can alter size selectivity over time, potentially biasing population estimates if not accounted for. Future assessments could explore time-varying selectivity models or incorporate empirical selectivity data from fishery-independent surveys to improve accuracy.

### Data constraints

Despite the comprehensive FEMP-04-AND monitoring program, several limitations influence assessment results. The temporal coverage of detailed biological sampling (2013-2024) is relatively short for stock assessment, potentially limiting ability to capture long-term population cycles, and sometime this deals with troubles  with Bzero estimates (**revisar citar**). Historical catch data limitations prevent reliable unfished biomass (B0) estimation, making biological reference point establishment challenging and preventing longer-term population trend analysis.

Environmental data integration remains incomplete despite basic oceanographic parameter collection. More detailed information on factors such as food availability, predator abundance, and habitat quality could improve recruitment variability understanding. However, environmental variables should only be incorporated once their influence on sensitive population processes like recruitment has been demonstrated.

## Management strategy evaluation and future directions


The development of a formal management strategy evaluation (MSE) framework appears as the logical next step. Such an approach would provide structured testing of alternative management strategies under uncertainty and different productivity scenarios (because currently, it is evident that wedge clam is experiencing a low productivity regime), allowing managers and stakeholders to explore trade-offs between conservation and economic objectives over longer time horizons. For data-limited fisheries such as wedge clam, MSE has been increasingly discussed and developed in a more generic context, often relying on empirical management rules such as minimum landing size (MLS), as highlighted by @Geromont2014, to evaluate performance and robustness under uncertainty.


Long-term implications of current MLS regulations remain uncertain due to the relatively short assessment period and complex dynamics of biological, environmental, and socioeconomic factors. Ongoing monitoring and periodic reassessment will be essential for adaptive fishery management as productivity conditions change. The integration of MLS regulations with other management measures, including spatially explicit regulations within designated management zones and the development of catch quotas through integrated models, could provide comprehensive support for establishing sustainable management procedures.

# CONCLUSION

**NO Esta lista la conclusion**

This study demonstrates the feasibility and utility of applying integrated stock assessment methods to an invertebrate species. By integrating multiple data sources and testing management scenarios, it provides methodological innovation and practical guidance for management. While uncertainties remain, particularly regarding parameter values and long-term dynamics, the results point towards precautionary and adaptive strategies that can secure the sustainability of the fishery.

More broadly, the wedge clam fishery of the Gulf of Cádiz illustrates how artisanal fisheries embedded in ecologically sensitive areas can move towards science-based management. The adoption of integrated assessment approaches represents an important step in aligning conservation and socioeconomic objectives. Although challenges persist, this study provides a strong foundation for future work and offers a cautiously optimistic outlook: with continued monitoring, adaptive management, and stakeholder engagement, the wedge clam fishery can become a model of sustainability for small-scale coastal fisheries in Europe.

The successful application of integrated stock assessment methods to the wedge clam fishery demonstrates the feasibility of applying sophisticated analytical tools to small-scale, data-limited fisheries. This represents an important advance for artisanal fishery management, which has traditionally relied on simpler approaches due to data constraints and resource limitations. The framework developed here could be adapted for other bivalve species and small-scale fisheries facing similar management challenges.

The importance of long-term monitoring programs for enabling quantitative assessments cannot be overstated. The FEMP-04-AND program provides a model for how relatively modest investments in consistent data collection can dramatically improve management capabilities. The integration of fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data sources proved crucial for model performance, suggesting that effective monitoring programs should incorporate both commercial and scientific sampling components.

The MLS policy evaluation framework developed in this study offers a template for assessing size-based management measures in other fisheries. The quantification of trade-offs between conservation and economic outcomes provides a foundation for evidence-based policy discussions that move beyond qualitative arguments to focus on measurable outcomes. This approach could be particularly valuable for fisheries operating in protected areas or facing conflicting management objectives.

The ecosystem context of the wedge clam fishery highlights the importance of considering broader environmental and conservation goals in fishery management decisions. The integration of population assessments with ecosystem services evaluation and conservation planning represents an emerging frontier in sustainable fisheries management that could benefit many small-scale fisheries operating in ecologically sensitive areas.
