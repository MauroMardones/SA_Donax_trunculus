abstract = {Granting property rights in fisheries is assumed to provide incentives for sustainable resource exploitation. These rights might also open other income options for fishers, including some that go beyond the original objectives intended by authorities establishing the right. The opportunity for alternative uses is especially high if the details of these rights are not clearly identified. In Chile, a de novo TURF (Territorial User Rights for Fishery) system, called Management Exploitation Areas for Benthic Resources ({\'{a}}reas de Manejo y Explotaci{\'{o}}n de Recursos Bent{\'{o}}nicos-AMERB) was created to achieve sustainable exploitation of benthic resources. This study compares two small-scale fishing communities in Chile, Guayac{\'{a}}n and Huentelauqu{\'{e}}n, representing two typical contrasting settings, regarding geographical contexts and surroundings, origin, history, location, social embeddedness, main fisheries activities as well as the motivation and the process through which they acquired their AMERB. While in Guayac{\'{a}}n the main fishing activity outside the AMERB is the giant squid and finfish fishery, in Huentelauqu{\'{e}}n the main and traditional activity has been diving for benthic resources. The objectives to acquire their AMERBs were different in both cases. Huentelauqu{\'{e}}n applied the AMERB for their traditional activity, the fishery of Concholepas concholepas (" loco" ), thus in accordance with the official objective of the AMERB. Due to reduced catches of loco, fishers also added the collection of kelps, using their AMERB to control access to the entire coast surrounding their fishing community, beyond the limits of their AMERB. In Guayac{\'{a}}n the AMERB, applied for the management of scallops and a species of red algae, began to be used for sea squirt aquaculture. Within the framework of sustainable fisheries implied by the AMERBs, there was in both cases a clear expectation to gain new sources of income. However with time both AMERBs are being used as a tool for territorial exclusion of other fishers beyond the limits of their respective AMERBs. In Huentelauqu{\'{e}}n fishers mention mostly negative aspects about the performance of their AMERB, given the poor economic results, being unsatisfied with the AMERB system in general, because they feel that the system disrupted their traditional migration along the coast. In Guayac{\'{a}}n, fishers mentioned mostly positive aspects for their AMERB, as it was an opportunity to add new activities. Both examples show that rights-based management approaches are very attractive; they could promote new uses or developments, whose sustainability nevertheless needs to be analyzed further. The analyzed case studies show that, contrary to how the system was developed in Chile, a more bottom-up implementation of new management arrangements may make it easier to agree on common objectives, and/or leave more freedom for fishers to adjust and arrange their livelihood. Considering the importance the AMERBs have acquired for fishers, these kinds of systems need flexible regulations in order that fishers can adapt the system to local traditions, uses or needs and also to their learning and adapting capacities. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Territorial User Rights for Fisheries (TURF) is considered an appropriate tool for small-scale fishery management. In Chile a TURFs system called Management Exploitation Areas for Benthic Resources ({\'{a}}reas de Manejo y Explotaci{\'{o}}n de Recursos Bent{\'{o}}nicos-AMERB) were developed as a solution for the fishery crisis of Concholepas concholepas, a hard bottom snail. The success of these AMERBs led to its widespread application across different fisheries resources and social-ecological contexts, among them the surf clam Mesodesma donacium which has a highly variable population. Traditionally, fishermen followed the sporadically appearing M. donacium beds, migrating along the coast, a behavior now suppressed under the AMERB regime. We examined the dynamics of the M. donacium fishery, evaluating the performance of the AMERB system for its sustainable exploitation. Fishermen extracted surf clams based on monthly quotas, which were conservative. Despite this, after three years the fishery of M. donacium within the AMERB collapsed because of lack of recruitment and high natural mortality. The resulting low abundances made the fishery unattractive, causing the abandonment of the AMERB. This suggests that implementation of an AMERB system must integrate knowledge of the spatial scales over which different clam beds (subpopulations) are connected. While still ignoring the structure of the metapopulation, as occurs at present for M. donacium stocks in Chile, it could be evaluated to increase capture during the periods of boom, taking advantage of surf clams that will disappear in any case due to natural mortality. A spatial reserve within each clam bed could also be established in order to conserve the unknown but potentially important role of the subpopulation for the metapopulation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In order to avoid conflicts when spatially explicit rules are implemented, it is critical to understand the spatial distribution of fishing effort, the migration patterns of fishermen and the use of temporary fishing camps. The migration of fishermen is a process shaped by historical patterns of resource availability, in addition to economic and political factors. We present an example in which a temporary fishing camp used for extraction of benthic resources (Loco: Concholepas concholepas) changed into a permanent one during the study period. Throughout the study period fishing effort (trips) was closely related to the productivity of the different fishing grounds, with more trips directed to the most productive areas. The conversion from a temporary to a permanent fishing camp did not improve the efficiency of the loco fishery, but did allow better access to alternative resources (surf clams) on nearby fishing grounds. The succession from simple shelters to a permanent 'caleta' is a common situation along the Chilean coast, motivated originally by resource availability and more recently by the creation of the TURF system. In particular the TURF system converts temporary (resource driven) movements of fishermen into rigid stationary caletas, which creates a number of problems. Temporary fishing camps are common when fishing grounds are far from the base port, but they require specific administrative tools in order to achieve sustainable fisheries management. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In Chile, a Territorial User Rights for Fisheries system was developed to manage benthic fisheries. This system is referred to as Management Areas for the Exploitation of Benthic Resources. Management areas involved a shift from top-down control by governments to comanagement. We have analyzed the effects of a highly variable fishery, characterized by boom-and-bust cycles, on the governance of local institutions designed for resource management. We focused on a case study in north central Chile, in which the surf clam fishery experienced high levels of variability when the fishery was in an open access system. The management areas were established for the fishery in 1999. As a result, a set of rules for the fishery were created and enforced by fishers and local fishery authorities. Despite intense efforts on the part of all stakeholders, the fishery collapsed after three years of management area policy. This approach has been shown to be an effective management option for other species; however, for resources with boom-and-bust cycles, it is important to understand the response pattern of users confronting this spatial and temporal variability before the establishment of territorial user rights. Defining the appropriate spatial scale of the territorial rights could allow fishers to switch among different surf clam beds to maintain their livelihood and support the sustainability of local institutions for resource management.},

In this area, a total of 223 artisanal boats (68{\%} of the artisanal fleet) are involved in shellfishing targeting bivalve molluscs, including the smooth clam. The artisanal mechanised dredging that targets C. chione in the northern Alboran Sea is described and the current exploitation status of its populations is analysed. A surplus-production model was run using ASPIC and used to assess the temporal variation in the levels of fishing for this bivalve throughout the study period (2002-2015), as well as to suggest conservation reference points that could guarantee the sustainable exploitation of this resource. During the study period, the maximum C. chione catch was registered in 2003 (306 t) and the minimum in 2006 (93 t). The ASPIC model for C. chione stock suggests that a Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) of 216 t could be produced from a total stock biomass of 983 t (Bmsy) at a fishing mortality rate of total biomass of 0.22 (Fmsy), with B/ Bmsy and F/Fmsy values of 1.34 and 0.82, respectively, indicating that the stock is approaching good status.},

abstract = {The precautionary approach calls for both target and limit reference points (TRPs and LRPs, respectively) and notes the vulnerability of developing fisheries to excess effort. LRPs should reflect a population's ability to continue to persist, which depends on lifetime egg production (LEP) and current abundance. The unique characteristics of sea urchin fisheries, such as (i) tight ecological coupling, (ii) their being roe fisheries, (iii) protection of juveniles under adult spine canopies, and (iv) broadcast spawning, can influence their management. Most North American sea urchin fisheries developed rapidly. Their reference points include (i) several LRPs and TRPs based on the logistic or surplus production model, (ii) a unique TRP involving direct monitoring of the bathymetric position of their macrophyte food, and (iii) an LRP based on the fraction of natural, unfished LEP. The dominant effect of fishing down and serial depletion on catch and effort data from developing sea urchin fisheries adversely affects fits to the logistic model. Reference points based on tight ecological coupling will be useful only where food webs are simple and one-dimensional. Sea urchin fisheries developed in the future should consider the fraction of natural LEP as an LRP and attempt to limit early excess fishing capacity.},

Prospecting campaigns were carried out between 2015 and 2017 along the FnideqTamernout area of the occidental Moroccan Mediterranean Sea, through artisanal boats equipped with hydraulic dredges for shellfish fishing. A total of 1526 samples of Callista chione were measured and weighed to estimate and thematically map the density of this species. The population structure, the length-weight relationship and the stock status were studied in total area. Results show that there was a significant difference of size structure distribution of the studied subareas. Mean length of all subareas was 69.15±1.13 mm with a minimum of 24.17 mm and a maximum of 105 mm. The large majority of the individuals (93{\%}) sampled presented the exploitable fraction of the stock. Length-weight relationship revealed a negative allometry for all subareas indicating that length grows faster than weight, except that of Amsa with positive allometry. Total biomass of C. chione records 17 million individuals for 1636 tons distributed over 8 subareas of homogeneous concentrations of different densities. Martil and M'diq present the most productive subareas with 78{\%} of total stock. These findings can be used to put rigorous and rational rules for fishing and stock management of this species so as to ensure the preservation of the C. chione resource and the sustainability of the socio-economic activity it generates in the region.},

abstract = {Variation in physical factors is considered the primary organizational force regulating macrobenthic populations and communities of exposed sandy beaches. However, there has been no quantitative evaluation of the intensity of human predation on the macrofauna inhabiting these systems, and information on biological interactions is also lacking. In the present study I review the results of a long-term monitoring study on the yellow clam Mesodesma mactroides (Deshayes, 1854) (Bivalvia: Mesodesmatidae) of an Uruguayan exposed sandy beach, including the effect of a human exclusion experiment as a way to acquire knowledge about its population structure and dynamics. Experimental management was based on the closure of the fishery for 32 months, in which a great part of the artisanal fishery community and the coastal marine authorities were involved in control operations. The experiment was a useful approach to testing the effect of fishing disturbing or altering the yellow clam population: the wide range of fishing effort levels through time allowed the detection of some patterns and processes that until the closure were unknown, namely: (I)the stock recruitment-relationship showed overcompensation, i.e. the inhibition of recruitment at highest adult densities; (2) growth rates of the newly settled cohorts were inversely correlated with the corresponding average adult density: (3) post-settlement natural mortality was highest in the densest cohorts, and was also a function of fishing activity; (4) the amount of fishing effort exerted over Mesodesma mactroides explained variations in abundance of the sympatric population of the wedge clam Donax hanleyanus Philippi, 1845 (Bivalvia: Donacidae). It is concluded that experimental management is a powerful approach to identify factors governing the dynamics of exploited sandy beach populations. to acquire the basic biological knowledge needed to perform adequate management strategies and to quantify the effect of harvesting on other components of the macrofauna. It is also stressed that further research in sandy beach populations should include human activities as important factors affecting long-term trends.},

Observations were made from March 1983 through March 1985 (harvesting season), and additional data from January 1988 to December 1989 (closed season) were also included in the analyses. Parameters of growth and mortality were estimated by methods that make use of age or length information. An age/length relationship was constructed by counting growth rings. Results were consistent with those obtained with modal class progression analysis and other length/frequency methods. The growth curve obtained from the age/length relationship did not account for seasonality in growth rate, and a seasonal growth model explained growth oscillations in a better way. The instantaneous coefficient of natural mortality (M) estimated for the closed season was 1.64, whereas an increase in fishing mortality (F) was observed during 1984. Age composition did not change during the 2 yr of study, and the first 6 mm class accounted for over 50{\%} of the population. The main contribution of recruits was observed between late summer and early fall (February to April), and the recruitment pattern suggested one main settlement period per year. Growth and recruitment success appeared to be regulated by density-dependence processes. Some implications for management are considered in this context. Methodological aspects concerning the reliability of empirical equations and programs for estimating growth and mortality are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1992 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Large-scale changes in American lobster (Homarus americanus) landings and abundance have been documented in both Canada and the United States over the last several decades. The spatial coherence of these changes suggests the importance of common environmental and fishery-related factors operating over broad areas in the western North Atlantic. Changes in both biotic and abiotic factors have been hypothesized to underlie the recent increases in lobster production. Area expansion of lobsters to previously unoccupied or low-density areas appears to be an important element of the population increase. Here, we review biological reference points applied to American lobster populations in the United States and Canada. Egg production per recruit models have been used to specify limit reference points (F10{\%} in the United States) or target reference points (increasing egg production per recruit to twice its 1995 level in Canada). Surplus production and yield-per-recruit models have also been employed to provide qualitative management guidelines. We describe sources of uncertainty in the development of biological reference points for American lobster based on dynamic pool models in relation to the precautionary approach. Finally we consider auxiliary indicators and reference points with potential application to lobster stocks.},

It aims to facilitate the development and implementation of indicators and to serve as a basis for the development of part of the series of Technical Guidelines in Support of the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. The paper reviews the concept of sustainable development ('sustainability'). Five sustainability frameworks are suggested for developing and grouping indicators. A discussion of the criteria that could be used to measure and monitor progress towards sustainability includes the types of possible indicators, their use within the sustainability concept, use of reference points on which to compare indicators and their relation to planning and management. Sustainable Development Reference Systems are introduced as a tool for grouping indicators and representing the interrelationships among them. Visual methods of portraying the human and environmental dimensions of sustainability and their indicators can be broadened to permit temporal and spatial comparisons. These, combined with systems to scale the different dimensions to reflect different societal values of their importance, can assist policy makers, fisheries managers, industries, non-governmental organizations and the general public in understanding and assessing progress towards sustainable development of capture fisheries.},

abstract = {The shell growth and reproductive cycle of Donax trunculus (Mollusca: Bivalvia) from southern Portugal were studied from December 1993 to November 1994. Both the acetate peel method and quantification of surface growth rings were used to establish age and estimate growth rate. Widely spaced growth bands were formed in spring and summer whilst narrowly spaced bands were deposited in late summer and early autumn. No cessation of growth was observed during the winter. The von Bertalanffy growth curve estimated from the internal bands did not differ significantly from that obtained from the surface rings. However, the age of clams can be determined more accurately from acetate peels than directly from surface rings. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that periodicity of the deposition of microgrowth bands was related to an innate rhythm. Gonadal development was monitored using standard histological methods. Both males and females showed synchronism in gonadal development. The gametogenic cycle began in late November and ended in late August. Spawning occurred between March and August with two major spawning phases: March and May-August. D. trunculus reached maturity during the first year of life.},

Five collecting areas were sampled in the Ria Formosa barrier islands, namely in the Culatra, Barreta and Armona Islands, between March and June 1998. The study was based on size frequency distribution analysis and shell biometric relationships. The size frequency distribution showed the predominance of smaller individuals ({\textless}25 mm) in the renewal area (0.5-1.0 m depth) and the prevalence of larger individuals (≥25 mm) at greater depths (4.0-6.0 m depth). The biometric study revealed the existence of significant differences in the type of growth between size classes in relation to depth distribution and burrowing activity. On the basis of these results, some specific management measures were proposed for this important bivalve fishery, taking into account the distinct fishing strategies and operations (manual and boat-operated dredging) performed at different depths.},

abstract = {Spatial fishing closures are typically implemented for conservation and fisheries benefits, but the effects of such initiatives are often not tested. This study examined whether the densities and size compositions of beach clams differed between commercially fished and non-fished zones on beaches. Sampling of clams was stratified across two habitats (swash and dry sand) on two commercially fished beaches, before and during (early and late) the 6-month harvesting period. Two beaches that had no commercial fishing were also sampled the same way and acted as external controls. Differences in densities, but not size compositions, of clams were evident between zones on the commercially fished and control beaches, but they were mostly apparent only across short (day and week) periods before, early and late harvesting, and thus were most likely pulse responses of clams to stochastic, non-fishing related events that acted independently across the different zones on each beach. The potential movements of clams along and across beaches as well as current restrictions on commercial fishing probably dampened detection of longer-term fishing-related impacts and demographic differences in clams between commercially fished and non-fished zones. Direct fishing-related impacts on clams may only be discernable in the immediate vicinity of, and persist for a short period following, an actual fishing event on a beach. Nevertheless, the zones closed to commercial fishing may provide valuable protection to a portion of clams on each beach and alleviate beach-wide harvesting impacts. The broader value of these closed fishing zones requires knowledge of the impacts of fishing on other beach organisms and ecosystem functioning. Further experimentation that tests other aspects of management arrangements of beach clams may help determine their global applicability for sustainable harvesting, and contribute to the overall conservation management of sandy beach ecosystems.},

abstract = {The study of the structure and the dynamics of populations exposed to environmental pollutants can be a useful investigative tool for finding the connections between different levels of biological organization Population dynamics on wedge clam, Donax trunculus is still unknown in Morocco. FiSAT software (FAO-ICLARM Stock Assessment Tools) was used for calculating population parameters of this species. The specimens of D. trunculus (Linnaeus, 1758) were collected monthly in the Agadir Marine Bay (South of Morocco) for two years (January 2016–December 2017) from three stations (S1, S2 and S3), which are directly exposed to eventual pollutants owing to the developing tourism resort Taghazout Bay. The study of the population dynamics of D. trunculus shows that the annual mean of density, biomass and condition index, presents significant seasonal variations depending on the physico-chemical parameters and the animal's life cycle. The monitoring of age-class frequency distributions of D. trunculus individuals revealed a slighter difference at the three study stations. Asymptotic length (L∞) was 37.96 mm and growth coefficient (K) was estimated at 1.93 year −1. Total mortality (Z) for D. trunculus was 3.30 year −1. Natural mortality (M) and fishing mortality (F) were 1.73 year−1 and 1.57 year −1 respectively. Exploitation level (E) was computed as 0.48, indicating an optimum level of exploitation of D. trunculus in the coastal waters of Taghazout. It is well demonstrated that bimodal recruitment takes place twice a year; one in late summer–early autumn and the other in spring. The results of this study provide information on the health status of this ecosystem receiving Taghazout Bay project.},

The stock assessment was supported on an integrated catch-at-size assessment model. The model described the population changes, including recruitment, selectivity, fishing mortality, individual growth patterns and survival over time, providing management quantities for the geoduck clam fishery, such as biomass-at-length (total and vulnerable) and harvest rate-at-length. The results indicated overfishing of the geoduck clam population; the harvest rate exceeded the management tactics established for this fishery, even the individuals smaller than the minimum legal size (130 mm) were harvested. Thus, declines in the total biomass (from 3,262 to 1,130 t) and recruitment (representing an 86{\%} decrease) were observed from 2010 to 2012. Although the results showed a recovery trend in recruitment and total biomass from 2014 to 2016, this trend may have been due to the spatial relocation of fishing mortality.},

abstract = {Generalized depletion models are useful for representing catch dynamics when biological compositional data are lacking but high frequency records of catch and effort are available. A shortcoming of these models is that although they estimate vulnerable abundance they do not provide direct information on the productivity of the stocks. Here we combine generalized depletion models with a biomass dynamic model of the Pella-Tomlinson type. The inference framework is hierarchical, with initial biomass estimates from generalized depletion models being used as input to the biomass dynamic model to estimate its hyper-parameters. Two hierarchical inference approaches are employed: the standard state-space framework and a new hybrid marginal-estimated approximation to the likelihood function, which make different simplifying assumptions. We apply this assessment approach to the first Chilean fishery with a Management Plan, the southern sea urchin fishery. Results from both hierarchical inference methods show a stock fluctuating between high and low biomass levels, for which maximum sustainable yield appears as a risk-prone annual harvest policy. Given this we propose an alternative annual harvest rate corresponding to the average latent productivity over the years of peaks and troughs of biomass fluctuations.},

abstract = {In this paper, we concentrate on spatial aspects of growth and reproduction for sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) to advance the general theory for development of reference points for sessile animals and to illustrate the general points with several specific examples. Nonlinear mixed effects models can be used to define the spatial distribution of growth rates and their implications for the definition of growth overfishing. We develop a basin model to illustrate that the typical "boom and bust" effects, often attributed to environmental factors, are explained equally well by spatial variations in habitat quality, spatial concentration of fisheries, and dispersal of larvae among areas. Results suggest that incentives to concentrate fishing effort in lower productivity areas may be an effective tool for reducing recruitment variation and improving yields. Reductions in fishing mortality might be possible with closed areas as they can be used to reduce the concentration of effort on high scallop densities. Further, rotational area management strategies can offer the promise of balancing demands for increased yield, prevention of recruitment overfishing, maintaining spawning reserves, and reducing habitat damage and bycatch.},

abstract = {In the context of applying the precautionary approach to fisheries management, much of the current attention on developing reference points has been focussed on finfish species. However, at present the largest marine fisheries in Canada in terms of landings and value are those for invertebrate species. A workshop on reference points for invertebrate fisheries was held in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, from 2 to 5 December 2002 to address the particular needs of fisheries on this diverse group of species. Seven of the papers presented at that workshop were published as a group in this issue of the Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Science. Reproduction and recruitment were identified by all of these papers as key elements of population resilience and productivity that needed to be monitored in some way. The monitoring of reproductive capacity should be extended to aspects important in the mating systems, such as local densities, spatial patterns of age-size structure, and spatial and temporal patterns of breeding areas for broadcast spawners with poorly mobile or sessile adults. Similarly, such monitoring would also include female and male size and the number of female reproductive opportunities for crustacean species with copulating adults.},

abstract = {This study was the first attempt to characterize the recreational harvesting of the wedge clam (Donax trunculus). For this purpose, 403 face-to-face interviews were performed in the summers of 2018 and 2019 in southern Portugal. The majority of the harvesters frequented the selected beaches during holidays and collected wedge clams as a hobby for an appetizer. The respondents reported an inter-annual variation in their catches of wedge clam with a decreasing abundance in 2018 followed by a recovery in 2019, but with more recreational harvesters collecting undersized individuals. Although most harvesters declared to consume D. trunculus, only a few bought wedge clams being the clams' size a secondary factor in their valorization. The majority of the recreational harvesters did not know the species' minimum conservation reference size nor the legally allowed maximum daily catch. It was estimated that recreational harvesters can collect 13 tonnes of wedge clams during the summer season along the southeastern coast of Algarve. Even though manual harvesting is not an efficient fishing technique, the lack of selectivity of harvesters can eventually compromise the resilience of D. trunculus populations. Despite most respondents affirmed to get informed about marine biotoxins, most surveys were done during periods of interdiction for shellfish harvesting. The present results revealed that the population is still unaware of the health risks of consuming shellfish contaminated with biotoxins. Educational activities and awareness campaigns are required to further inform recreational harvesters about the regulations in force for this activity and the sanitary threats of marine biotoxins.},

abstract = {In this study, the release effects of the buried clam Meretrix meretrix in a northern estuary of China (Shuangtaizi Estuary) was assessed in terms of population ecology and genetic variability by using longer-term monitoring data from 2011 (used as the baseline data) to 2018. A total of 2.4 × 108 hatchery juveniles were released from 2012 to 2014, and follow-up monitoring survey of the growth, distribution, density, and biomass of M. meretrix population was carried out. Results showed a temporary spike in the population of M. meretrix, and the population underwent considerable year-to-year fluctuations in total abundance and biomass. Meanwhile, the age structure of the populations from 2011 to 2018 is still an unstable expanding type. Genetic analysis based on 10 polymorphic microsatellite markers revealed no significant genetic differentiation and weak genetic structures between years but higher genetic diversities in 2014–2018 than in the initial period (2013) of stock restoration. Our study suggests that effective policies for management and conservation to restore M. meretrix population by local governments are still needed in the long run.},

abstract = {This study aimed to augment existing knowledge of the reproductive characteristics of Donax trunculus through analysis of timing variations and the influence of shell size on partial fecundity (PF) during the reproductive period. To achieve this objective, two reproductive timing characteristics were also studied: size at first maturity (SL50) and the reproductive cycle using histology and image analysis techniques. SL50 was 10.83 mm for females and 10.86 for males. Donax trunculus showed a continuous and simultaneous release of gametes and high oocyte regeneration ability during the reproductive period (from February to July). These reproductive characteristics impeded the estimation of total fecundity. However, throughout the reproductive period an increasing pattern of PF was observed followed by a significant drop at the end of the same period, which could be quantified (293,390 of vitellogenic and ripe oocytes). At the same time PF quantifications allowed for predicting and estimating the influence of shell length (SL) on the reproductive output as a function of oocyte typology (PF = 4.12 + 3.96 SL; r 2 = 0.86; all types). Levels of prevalence of a digenetic trematode-like parasite with castrate ability fluctuated between 0-20{\%} depending on the time of the year and sex. In addition, the possible consequences of two different scenarios of population size structure on the reproductive output were simulated, and highlighted how beach areas supporting high levels of anthropogenic pressure (Isla Canela) could compromise future recruitments, producing 84{\%} less oocytes than a beach with a lower level of disturbance (Do{\~{n}}ana).},

First an in-depth analysis of the shell and updated estimation of growth parameters of the intertidal D. trunculus population were performed between January 2014 and July 2015 using two different methods i) thin-layer cross section (TL) (ii) length-frequency distributions (LFD). Von Bertalanffy growth functions provided an asymptotic length of 46 mm (LFD) and 46.7 mm (TL) and growth constants of 0.48 (LFD) and 0.47 yr−1 (TL) in Do{\~{n}}ana beach. In addition, several deformities as well as signs of shell repair were observed. Population dynamics analyses through length-frequency distribution clarified the timing of recruitment (February–March and July). The mean annual biomass (B¯) of intertidal populations of D. trunculus ranged between 3.03 (Do{\~{n}}ana) and 3.31 g ash-free dry mass (AFDW) m−2 yr−1 (Isla Canela). Individual production showed the highest value at 27 mm length (0.117 g AFDW m−2 yr−1) and annual production (P) ranged between 3.40 (Do{\~{n}}ana) and 4.91 g (Isla Canela), resulting in renewal rate (P/B¯) values between 1.03 and 1.61, respectively. The present results, together with information on environmental parameters, revealed clear differences in population dynamics and production between beaches related to the presence or absence of a protection figure.},

abstract = {In a resource management perspective, the understanding of the relative influence of the physical factors on species connectivity remains a major challenge and is also of great ecological and conservation biology interest. Despite the overfishing threat on the wedge clam Donax trunculus in Europe, relatively little information is known about its population genetic structure and connectivity and their consequences on conservation policies. We employed 16 microsatellite loci to characterise the genetic diversity and population structure of D. trunculus. A total of 514 samples from seven different localities along the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition, from the Atlantic (Gulf of C{\'{a}}diz) to the north-western Mediterranean were genotyped. The analysis of the population genetic structure displayed a clear distinction along the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition with different clusters in the Atlantic Ocean, the Alboran Sea and the northwestern Mediterranean. Consequently, we recommend that these three areas should be considered as different management units. We showed that all populations seem to be at high long-term risk of extinction with the exception of the protected Do{\~{n}}ana National Park population which still seems to have evolutionary potential. Therefore, our results emphasized the necessity of protection of this economic resource and the validity of molecular tools to evaluate the population dynamics.},

abstract = {Stock synthesis (SS) is a statistical age-structured population modeling framework that has been applied in a wide variety of fish assessments globally. The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Many criteria for statistical parameter estimation, such as maximum likelihood, are formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem. Automatic Differentiation Model Builder (ADMB) is a programming framework based on automatic differentiation, aimed at highly nonlinear models with a large number of parameters. The benefits of using AD are computational efficiency and high numerical accuracy, both crucial in many practical problems. We describe the basic components and the underlying philosophy of ADMB, with an emphasis on functionality found in no other statistical software. One example of such a feature is the generic implementation of Laplace approximation of high-dimensional integrals for use in latent variable models. We also review the literature in which ADMB has been used, and discuss future development of ADMB as an open source project. Overall, the main advantages of ADMB are flexibility, speed, precision, stability and built-in methods to quantify uncertainty. {\textcopyright} 2012 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {The opaque nature of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing means that the data on catches are scarce or unreliable, making it difficult to estimate the volume of illegal fishing and the number of individuals who practice it. In this work, we develop the use of quantification methods for IUU fishing in data-poor fisheries and provide estimates for the main shellfish species exploited in S-fisheries in Galicia (NW Spain). To make the estimates, we use a model whose primary input is the Confiscations per unit of policing effort (CPUPE) index, which relates the sanctions imposed for poaching, estimated poaching, and confiscations carried out by the Enforcement Forces. The estimates for the period 2012–2020 are 660.2 t of illegal catches of different species and an average number of 1,766.2 poachers/year. These estimates provide evidence that makes it possible to analyse tendencies in illegal fishing, to establish assessment baselines and to highlight potential improvements in the fight against IUU fishing in small-scale fisheries.},

Combining revealed and stated preferences data from an on-site survey and using a pseudo-panel approach shows that people significantly value health risks. The combination of stated and revealed preferences data is realised through the introduction of the concept of a “hypothetical twin site”. Addressing on-site sampling issues within the framework of a random-effect Poisson gamma model allows a derivation of more accurate estimates of welfare measures. Results also suggest that the demand for recreational shellfish harvesting is an inferior good.}

abstract = {In the sandy shores of the Spanish Mediterranean, Donax trunculus (Linnaeus, 1758) has a high commercial interest. In the Gulf of Valencia, poor management of fishing activity led to its closure in June 2015. The objective of this study was to analyze the evolution of the catches of D. trunculus before the closure of the fishery as well as the biomass and density of the population in the months following the closure, plus 2 y later. The area of study was located in the main fishing area of the Gulf of Valencia, which belongs to the fleet of the Gandia Fishermen's Guild. The fishing beds for this clam are found on sandy sediments in shallow waters (between 0 and 2 m). During the 10 y previous to the fishery closure, the annual catch per unit effort of D. trunculus suffered a sharp decrease, falling from values between 37 and 42 (kg small vessel-1d-1) during the period 2004-2008 to 5.5 in 2014. After the closure, the biomass and density of the wedge clam showed a seasonal pattern, with maximum values in summer, as well as notable differences in densities along the shore in each sampled month. Furthermore, a different size-frequency distribution across depth, with smaller individuals in the shallower areas, was observed. Nevertheless, a general and considerable decline for biomass and density from 2015 (monthly mean of commercial biomass ranged from 24 to 48 kg ha-1) to 2017 (from 4 to 13 kg ha-1) was noted. This indicates that the closure did not improve the state of the population. There are several hypotheses that could explain this decline such as overfishing, changes in environmental conditions, higher predation (in benthic and planktonic phases), and the reduction of food availability. Therefore, there would be a need to study them in greater depth, as well as to increase the understanding of the spatial dynamics and connectivity of the Donax beds.},

abstract = {Recruitment of benthic marine invertebrates varies greatly at different spatio-temporal scales. For instance, population dynamics of the yellow clam Mesodesma mactroides at Uruguay exhibit large temporal fluctuations, mainly associated with recruitment. We used data from an 8 yr long-term study to develop an age-structured model to show that density-dependent and density-independent forces acting together can jointly explain the population fluctuations in a sandy-beach bivalve population of the yellow clam Mesodesma mactroides. The pure density-dependent deterministic model parameterised with empirical values estimated during the 8 yr study predicted stable dynamics. The dynamics of the deterministic skeleton was markedly influenced by the addition of a relatively small amount of stochastic variability to fertility rates. The yellow clam population dynamics seem to be driven by the combined forces of density-dependent and density-independent factors operating together. A combination of (uncorrelated) stochasticity in reproductive rates and asymmetric intercohort interactions (density-dependent recruitment and density-dependent survival rates) seems to be the key process generating large variability in recruitment.},

At each of these. 1 m2 quadrats were excavated with a spade to an approximate depth of 8 cm. The sediment was sieved through a mesh of 1 mm. Samples were also collected for grain size analysis. Analysis of length-frequency histograms shows that the maximum abundance of recruits (individuals {\textless} 8 mm) occurred during the wannest months of the year, but recruitment was scattered in space, and apparently enhanced near the proximity of a river mouth. Regression analyses showed a significant correlation between abundance of recruits and percentage of fine sand, with the significance decreasing with increase in the size of recruits. These results suggest that grain size characteristics(i.e .. {\%} infine sands) are impot1ant in explaining the spatial distribution of recruitment in D. serra.},

The results showed that its distribution was patchy. Adult clams were confined to the surf zone, while the vast majority of juveniles occurred in the swash zone. The highest densities of adults were found in summer and autumn (up to 1.59 individuals per 0.25 m2 in February 1989), while the minimum occurred during winter. juveniles had similar densities all year round (up to 16-20 individuals per 0.25 m2). Most clams collected in the surf zone had similar shell lengths (70-75 mm); those collected in the swash zone were smaller than 25 mm. No relationships were found between distribution and abundances of clams and variability in textural characteristics of the surf or swash zone. Due to the limited longshore variability in grain size and sorting of sands, it is suggested that the variabilities in distribution and abundances of clams may be related to large-scale habitat characteristics rather than to small-scale textural variability.},

abstract = {Long-term datasets can be particularly useful for parsing out factors influencing populations, yet few studies have utilized continuous datasets to quantify population dynamics in bivalve molluscs. We used dynamic factor analysis on a clam biomass dataset spanning 28 yr and five distinct regions in the southern Salish Sea to determine (1) if native intertidal clam populations exhibit synchrony and (2) what environmental covariates may be correlated with these population trends. Once covariates were accounted for, the model with the most data support included three predominant trends to describe multidecadal change in clam biomass. Intraspecific synchrony was highest among Saxidomus gigantea and Leukoma staminea populations, with no clear evidence of covariance in Clinocardium nuttallii. Specifically, we quantified a pronounced decadal decline in L. staminea and an increase in S. gigantea biomass on most beaches. No beaches showed synchrony in trends across all three species, indicating that species-specific trends (regardless of location) were more common than beach-specific trends (regardless of species). Seven environmental covariates were evaluated in their capacity to explain variability in annual mean biomass. Of these, the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation lagged 4 yr prior to the observation year was most supported by the data in the best fitting model, implying that 4 yr old clam biomass is partially determined by oceanographic processes affecting larval clams. Although results suggest large-scale density-independent factors play a role in venerid clam population dynamics, it is also likely local factors account for variability not explained by our model.},

abstract = {Small-scale fisheries are frequently overlooked for research and management, and their social and environmental impacts are often overlooked as well, preventing the implementation of appropriate actions for their sustainability. Additionally, the dynamics of beach clam fisheries and their importance for local communities are not well understood. A study on the population biology of the clam Tivela mactroides in Caraguatatuba Bay, southeastern Brazil, revealed intense harvesting of this resource by both residents and tourists. To assess the extent and dynamics of clamming, the number of harvesters was recorded during the course of the day in vacation and nonvacation periods throughout 2003–2005 and 2007–2008; the number of other beach users, weather conditions, and tide height were also recorded. The overall amount of clams harvested was estimated based on censuses of clammers and interviews to calculate the amount of clams harvested per collecting event. The intensity and dynamics of the harvesting activity varied on all the temporal scales evaluated. The estimated amount of clams harvested per year decreased from the first (24.6 kg/year) to the second (8.8 kg/year) group of sampling years, presumably due to clam mass-mortality events and smaller shell sizes in 2007–2008, although clam abundance increased enormously. Vacation periods (presence of tourists) influenced the number of harvesters and the daily dynamics of clamming activity, although this relationship was only evident during 2003–2004. The number of harvesters increased with the number of tourists, except in periods of very high tourist activity, when harvesting decreased. Clamming was more widespread during the day under high tourist activity but during nonvacation times was concentrated in morning low-tide periods. Weather had a partial influence on clamming, with harvesters absent only during intense rain occasions. The understanding of the dynamics of this Tivela mactroides fishery highlights key points for planning and implementing management measures, which will involve continuous monitoring of stocks, harvesting, and food safety.

abstract = {The American razor clam Ensis americunus (= E. directus) was introduced into the eastern North Sea in the late 1970s. By larval and postlarval drifting the species rapidly extended its distribution, now ranging from the English Channel to the Kattegat. Near the island of Sylt in the eastern North Sea it has been recorded since 1979. Recruitment was rather irregular, with about six strong year-classes within two decades. Growth seems comparable with populations in its native range (Atlantic North America). Although present in the lower intertidal zone, maximum densities occurred in shallow subtidal sand with a biomass similar to that of dense beds of native cockles and mussels in the adjacent intertidal zone. Ensis americanus established in otherwise sparsely faunated sand (channels exposed to strong currents) as well as in dense infaunal assemblages (lower intertidal and subtidally). There were no significant interactions with resident species. In dense beds of razor clams, however, fine sediment particles accumulated which may have altered abundances of polychaetes. In spite of high annual variability, E. americanus has become a prominent component of the macrobenthos in shallow subtidal sands of the North Sea.

abstract = {Burrowing ability, shape and density of 12 bivalve species from a wide range of beach types were compared as part of a general investigation of the adaptations of bivalves to the swash climates experienced on exposed sandy beaches. The genera used were Donax, Mesodesma, Tivela, Siliqua, Atactodea, Paphies and Donacilla. Burrowing rates varied widely and burrowing ability showed no relation to beach type along the reflective/dissipative beach gradient, i.e. from beaches with low wave energy and coarse sand to beaches with high wave energy and fine sand. Burrowing rate indices (BRI's) ranged from 2 to 17 (rapid to very rapid) and tended to be higher for juveniles of most species. Bivalve species from dissipative beaches varied in shape from almost blade-shaped to almost spherical, whereas those from reflective beaches were more uniform generally wedge-shaped. Species with the most flattened shapes and (greatest height/width ratios) tended to burrow fastest. Striking interspecific differences were found in densities of whole intact bivalves, these ranging from 1.04 g {\textperiodcentered} cm-3 to 2.10 g {\textperiodcentered} cm-3. The highest densities were recorded in bivalves from reflective beaches and the lowest in bivalves from dissipative beaches. Bivalve species typical of intermediate and reflective beaches were successfully separated from those typical of dissipative beaches on the basis of their density, morphology and BRI, particularly their size and density, using discriminant analysis. It is concluded that small species with high density and streamlined shape are best adapted to the dynamic swash conditions that characterise reflective beaches. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

Conservation of beaches as functional ecosystems and protection of their unique biodiversity requires management interventions that not only mitigate threats to physical properties of sandy shores, but also include ecological dimensions. Yet, beach management remains overwhelmingly focused on engineering interventions. Here we summarise the key outcomes of several workshops, held during the 2006 Sandy Beach Ecology Symposium in Vigo, Spain, that addressed issues of climate change, beach management and sampling methodology. Because efficient communication between managers and ecologists is critical, we summarise the salient features of sandy beaches as functional ecosystems in 50 'key statements'; these provide a succinct synopsis of the main structural and functional characteristics of these highly dynamic systems. Key outcomes of the workshops include a set of recommendations on designs and methods for sampling the benthic infaunal communities of beaches, the identification of the main ecological effects caused by direct and indirect human interventions, the predicted consequence of climate change for beach ecosystems, and priority areas for future research. {\textcopyright} Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing.},

The equilibrium beach is defined as the hypothetical final shape that a be- ach would reach for a given constant wave forcing. Although this equilibrium shape is not possible in nature, since the stationary state is never reach, this «ideal» concept is widely used since allows beach investigators to have an approximate, but realistic, re- presentation of the beach morphology. Equilibrium beach consists of three elements, equilibrium beach profile, equilibrium plan form and equilibrium grain size distribution. Regarding the equilibrium beach profile, new developed models represent the profile in two different zones, allowing a better representation of the processes involved in the breaking and shoaling part of the profiles. These new models (Medina et al., 2000) also allow including the effect of the wave reflection from the beach and the tide. The most widely used formulation for representing the equilibrium plan form is the one pro- posed by Hsu and Evans (1989), recent advances in this area have been oriented to in- crease the capabilities of the formulation for predictive and design purposes (Gonz{\'{a}}lez y Medina, 2001). Finally new equilibrium grain size distribution formulations are pre- sented. These formulations have been recently developed (Galofr{\'{e}} y Medina, 2000) and give information on the sand distribution compatible with the existing wave conditions.},

abstract = {The yellow clam Mesodesma mactroides (Bivalvia: Mesodesmatidae) was once the most abundant intertidal species on the Atlantic coast of northern Argentina and an important commercial resource in South America. This study of a population inhabiting the intertidal zone of the sheltered-dissipative sandy beach Santa Teresita documents the species' population biology, including demographic structure, growth and production during December 2004 and December 2006, and adumbrates the critical state of M. mactroides at present. A total of 3,015 M. mactroides were collected and measured, whereas individuals were found with an anterior-posterior shell length between 2 and 64 mm. A von Bertalanffy growth function with an asymptotic length (L∞) of 85 mm and a growth constant (K) of 0.47 year-1 was established from length-frequency distributions. The longevity of the species is estimated at approximately 6 years, and instantaneous mortality rate was about three times higher than 40 years ago. Besides, this study confirmed that the overall growth performance index (OGP) is habitat-specific and can be used to group M. mactroides and M. donacium from different areas into temperate and upwelling species. Furthermore, OGP is inversely correlated with the latitudinal distribution of Mesodesma populations. The intertidal biomass ranged between 0.06 and 0.07 g AFDM m-2 year-1. Individual production was observed to be highest at 47 mm length (0.35 g AFDM m-2 year-1), and annual production ranged between 0.12 and 0.19 g AFDM m-2 year-1, resulting in productivity values (P/B) between 1.84 and 2.93. The comparison of the results of the present study with those of growth studies conducted on M. mactroides 40 years ago revealed the following considerable differences in the population structure of M. mactroides, indicating the conservation status of this intertidal bivalve as endangered: (1) present growth rates are faster, but that the maximum length attained has decreased, (2) the numbers of individuals per square metre were many times higher in the past than in the present, (3) bivalves from the present work never reached the 'commercial size' of 60 mm and (4) 40 years ago, the population of M. mactroides was composed of up to three cohorts, whereas in this study, there was only one single cohort visible. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag and AWI.},

abstract = {Spatial fishing closures are typically implemented for conservation and fisheries benefits, but the effects of such initiatives are often not tested. This study examined whether the densities and size compositions of beach clams differed between commercially fished and non-fished zones on beaches. Sampling of clams was stratified across two habitats (swash and dry sand) on two commercially fished beaches, before and during (early and late) the 6-month harvesting period. Two beaches that had no commercial fishing were also sampled the same way and acted as external controls. Differences in densities, but not size compositions, of clams were evident between zones on the commercially fished and control beaches, but they were mostly apparent only across short (day and week) periods before, early and late harvesting, and thus were most likely pulse responses of clams to stochastic, non-fishing related events that acted independently across the different zones on each beach. The potential movements of clams along and across beaches as well as current restrictions on commercial fishing probably dampened detection of longer-term fishing-related impacts and demographic differences in clams between commercially fished and non-fished zones. Direct fishing-related impacts on clams may only be discernable in the immediate vicinity of, and persist for a short period following, an actual fishing event on a beach. Nevertheless, the zones closed to commercial fishing may provide valuable protection to a portion of clams on each beach and alleviate beach-wide harvesting impacts. The broader value of these closed fishing zones requires knowledge of the impacts of fishing on other beach organisms and ecosystem functioning. Further experimentation that tests other aspects of management arrangements of beach clams may help determine their global applicability for sustainable harvesting, and contribute to the overall conservation management of sandy beach ecosystems.},

abstract = {Stock synthesis (SS) is a statistical age-structured population modeling framework that has been applied in a wide variety of fish assessments globally. The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {This study aimed to augment existing knowledge of the reproductive characteristics of Donax trunculus through analysis of timing variations and the influence of shell size on partial fecundity (PF) during the reproductive period. To achieve this objective, two reproductive timing characteristics were also studied: size at first maturity (SL50) and the reproductive cycle using histology and image analysis techniques. SL50 was 10.83 mm for females and 10.86 for males. Donax trunculus showed a continuous and simultaneous release of gametes and high oocyte regeneration ability during the reproductive period (from February to July). These reproductive characteristics impeded the estimation of total fecundity. However, throughout the reproductive period an increasing pattern of PF was observed followed by a significant drop at the end of the same period, which could be quantified (293,390 of vitellogenic and ripe oocytes). At the same time PF quantifications allowed for predicting and estimating the influence of shell length (SL) on the reproductive output as a function of oocyte typology (PF = 4.12 + 3.96 SL; r 2 = 0.86; all types). Levels of prevalence of a digenetic trematode-like parasite with castrate ability fluctuated between 0-20{\%} depending on the time of the year and sex. In addition, the possible consequences of two different scenarios of population size structure on the reproductive output were simulated, and highlighted how beach areas supporting high levels of anthropogenic pressure (Isla Canela) could compromise future recruitments, producing 84{\%} less oocytes than a beach with a lower level of disturbance (Do{\~{n}}ana).},

First an in-depth analysis of the shell and updated estimation of growth parameters of the intertidal D. trunculus population were performed between January 2014 and July 2015 using two different methods i) thin-layer cross section (TL) (ii) length-frequency distributions (LFD). Von Bertalanffy growth functions provided an asymptotic length of 46 mm (LFD) and 46.7 mm (TL) and growth constants of 0.48 (LFD) and 0.47. yr−1 (TL) in Do{\~{n}}ana beach. In addition, several deformities as well as signs of shell repair were observed. Population dynamics analyses through length-frequency distribution clarified the timing of recruitment (February–March and July). The mean annual biomass (B¯) of intertidal populations of D. trunculus ranged between 3.03 (Do{\~{n}}ana) and 3.31 g ash-free dry mass (AFDW) m−2 yr−1 (Isla Canela). Individual production showed the highest value at 27 mm length (0.117 gAFDWm−2 yr−1) and annual production (P) ranged between 3.40 (Do{\~{n}}ana) and 4.91 g (Isla Canela), resulting in renewal rate (P/B¯) values between 1.03 and 1.61, respectively. The present results, together with information on environmental parameters, revealed clear differences in population dynamics and production between beaches related to the presence or absence of a protection figure.},

Both the acetate peel method and quantification of surface growth rings were used to establish age and estimate growth rate. Widely spaced growth bands were formed in spring and summer whilst narrowly spaced bands were deposited in late summer and early autumn. No cessation of growth was observed during the winter. The von Bertalanffy growth curve estimated from the internal bands did not differ significantly from that obtained from the surface rings. However, the age of clams can be determined more accurately from acetate peels than directly from surface rings. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that periodicity of the deposition of microgrowth bands was related to an innate rhythm. Gonadal development was monitored using standard histological methods. Both males and females showed synchronism in gonadal development. The gametogenic cycle began in late November and ended in late August. Spawning occurred between March and August with two major spawning phases: March and May-August. D. trunculus reached maturity during the first year of life.},

Sampling of clams was stratified across two habitats (swash and dry sand) on two commercially fished beaches, before and during (early and late) the 6-month harvesting period. Two beaches that had no commercial fishing were also sampled the same way and acted as external controls. Differences in densities, but not size compositions, of clams were evident between zones on the commercially fished and control beaches, but they were mostly apparent only across short (day and week) periods before, early and late harvesting, and thus were most likely pulse responses of clams to stochastic, non-fishing related events that acted independently across the different zones on each beach. The potential movements of clams along and across beaches as well as current restrictions on commercial fishing probably dampened detection of longer-term fishing-related impacts and demographic differences in clams between commercially fished and non-fished zones. Direct fishing-related impacts on clams may only be discernable in the immediate vicinity of, and persist for a short period following, an actual fishing event on a beach. Nevertheless, the zones closed to commercial fishing may provide valuable protection to a portion of clams on each beach and alleviate beach-wide harvesting impacts. The broader value of these closed fishing zones requires knowledge of the impacts of fishing on other beach organisms and ecosystem functioning. Further experimentation that tests other aspects of management arrangements of beach clams may help determine their global applicability for sustainable harvesting, and contribute to the overall conservation management of sandy beach ecosystems.},

abstract = {The study of the structure and the dynamics of populations exposed to environmental pollutants can be a useful investigative tool for finding the connections between different levels of biological organization Population dynamics on wedge clam, Donax trunculus is still unknown in Morocco. FiSAT software (FAO-ICLARM Stock Assessment Tools) was used for calculating population parameters of this species. The specimens of D. trunculus (Linnaeus, 1758) were collected monthly in the Agadir Marine Bay (South of Morocco) for two years (January 2016–December 2017) from three stations (S1, S2 and S3), which are directly exposed to eventual pollutants owing to the developing tourism resort Taghazout Bay. The study of the population dynamics of D. trunculus shows that the annual mean of density, biomass and condition index, presents significant seasonal variations depending on the physico-chemical parameters and the animal's life cycle. The monitoring of age-class frequency distributions of D. trunculus individuals revealed a slighter difference at the three study stations. Asymptotic length (L∞) was 37.96 mm and growth coefficient (K) was estimated at 1.93 year −1. Total mortality (Z) for D. trunculus was 3.30 year −1. Natural mortality (M) and fishing mortality (F) were 1.73 year−1 and 1.57 year −1 respectively. Exploitation level (E) was computed as 0.48, indicating an optimum level of exploitation of D. trunculus in the coastal waters of Taghazout. It is well demonstrated that bimodal recruitment takes place twice a year; one in late summer–early autumn and the other in spring. The results of this study provide information on the health status of this ecosystem receiving Taghazout Bay project.},

abstract = {In a resource management perspective, the understanding of the relative influence of the physical factors on species connectivity remains a major challenge and is also of great ecological and conservation biology interest. Despite the overfishing threat on the wedge clam Donax trunculus in Europe, relatively little information is known about its population genetic structure and connectivity and their consequences on conservation policies. We employed 16 microsatellite loci to characterise the genetic diversity and population structure of D. trunculus. A total of 514 samples from seven different localities along the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition, from the Atlantic (Gulf of C{\'{a}}diz) to the north-western Mediterranean were genotyped. The analysis of the population genetic structure displayed a clear distinction along the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition with different clusters in the Atlantic Ocean, the Alboran Sea and the northwestern Mediterranean. Consequently, we recommend that these three areas should be considered as different management units. We showed that all populations seem to be at high long-term risk of extinction with the exception of the protected Do{\~{n}}ana National Park population which still seems to have evolutionary potential. Therefore, our results emphasized the necessity of protection of this economic resource and the validity of molecular tools to evaluate the population dynamics.},

abstract = {This study was the first attempt to characterize the recreational harvesting of the wedge clam (Donax trunculus). For this purpose, 403 face-to-face interviews were performed in the summers of 2018 and 2019 in southern Portugal. The majority of the harvesters frequented the selected beaches during holidays and collected wedge clams as a hobby for an appetizer. The respondents reported an inter-annual variation in their catches of wedge clam with a decreasing abundance in 2018 followed by a recovery in 2019, but with more recreational harvesters collecting undersized individuals. Although most harvesters declared to consume D. trunculus, only a few bought wedge clams being the clams' size a secondary factor in their valorization. The majority of the recreational harvesters did not know the species' minimum conservation reference size nor the legally allowed maximum daily catch. It was estimated that recreational harvesters can collect 13 tonnes of wedge clams during the summer season along the southeastern coast of Algarve. Even though manual harvesting is not an efficient fishing technique, the lack of selectivity of harvesters can eventually compromise the resilience of D. trunculus populations. Despite most respondents affirmed to get informed about marine biotoxins, most surveys were done during periods of interdiction for shellfish harvesting. The present results revealed that the population is still unaware of the health risks of consuming shellfish contaminated with biotoxins. Educational activities and awareness campaigns are required to further inform recreational harvesters about the regulations in force for this activity and the sanitary threats of marine biotoxins.},

abstract = {Variation in physical factors is considered the primary organizational force regulating macrobenthic populations and communities of exposed sandy beaches. However, there has been no quantitative evaluation of the intensity of human predation on the macrofauna inhabiting these systems, and information on biological interactions is also lacking. In the present study I review the results of a long-term monitoring study on the yellow clam Mesodesma mactroides (Deshayes, 1854) (Bivalvia: Mesodesmatidae) of an Uruguayan exposed sandy beach, including the effect of a human exclusion experiment as a way to acquire knowledge about its population structure and dynamics. Experimental management was based on the closure of the fishery for 32 months, in which a great part of the artisanal fishery community and the coastal marine authorities were involved in control operations. The experiment was a useful approach to testing the effect of fishing disturbing or altering the yellow clam population: the wide range of fishing effort levels through time allowed the detection of some patterns and processes that until the closure were unknown, namely: (I)the stock recruitment-relationship showed overcompensation, i.e. the inhibition of recruitment at highest adult densities; (2) growth rates of the newly settled cohorts were inversely correlated with the corresponding average adult density: (3) post-settlement natural mortality was highest in the densest cohorts, and was also a function of fishing activity; (4) the amount of fishing effort exerted over Mesodesma mactroides explained variations in abundance of the sympatric population of the wedge clam Donax hanleyanus Philippi, 1845 (Bivalvia: Donacidae). It is concluded that experimental management is a powerful approach to identify factors governing the dynamics of exploited sandy beach populations. to acquire the basic biological knowledge needed to perform adequate management strategies and to quantify the effect of harvesting on other components of the macrofauna. It is also stressed that further research in sandy beach populations should include human activities as important factors affecting long-term trends.},

Meanwhile, the age structure of the populations from 2011 to 2018 is still an unstable expanding type. Genetic analysis based on 10 polymorphic microsatellite markers revealed no significant genetic differentiation and weak genetic structures between years but higher genetic diversities in 2014–2018 than in the initial period (2013) of stock restoration.

The model described the population changes, including recruitment, selectivity, fishing mortality, individual growth patterns and survival over time, providing management quantities for the geoduck clam fishery, such as biomass-at-length (total and vulnerable) and harvest rate-at-length. The results indicated overfishing of the geoduck clam population; the harvest rate exceeded the management tactics established for this fishery, even the individuals smaller than the minimum legal size (130 mm) were harvested. Thus, declines in the total biomass (from 3,262 to 1,130 t) and recruitment (representing an 86{\%} decrease) were observed from 2010 to 2012.

Prospecting campaigns were carried out between 2015 and 2017 along the FnideqTamernout area of the occidental Moroccan Mediterranean Sea, through artisanal boats equipped with hydraulic dredges for shellfish fishing. A total of 1526 samples of Callista chione were measured and weighed to estimate and thematically map the density of this species. The population structure, the length-weight relationship and the stock status were studied in total area. Results show that there was a significant difference of size structure distribution of the studied subareas. Mean length of all subareas was 69.15±1.13 mm with a minimum of 24.17 mm and a maximum of 105 mm. The large majority of the individuals (93{\%}) sampled presented the exploitable fraction of the stock. Length-weight relationship revealed a negative allometry for all subareas indicating that length grows faster than weight, except that of Amsa with positive allometry. Total biomass of C. chione records 17 million individuals for 1636 tons distributed over 8 subareas of homogeneous concentrations of different densities. Martil and M'diq present the most productive subareas with 78{\%} of total stock. These findings can be used to put rigorous and rational rules for fishing and stock management of this species so as to ensure the preservation of the C. chione resource and the sustainability of the socio-economic activity it generates in the region.},

Automatic Differentiation Model Builder (ADMB) is a programming framework based on automatic differentiation, aimed at highly nonlinear models with a large number of parameters. The benefits of using AD are computational efficiency and high numerical accuracy, both crucial in many practical problems. We describe the basic components and the underlying philosophy of ADMB, with an emphasis on functionality found in no other statistical software. One example of such a feature is the generic implementation of Laplace approximation of high-dimensional integrals for use in latent variable models. We also review the literature in which ADMB has been used, and discuss future development of ADMB as an open source project. Overall, the main advantages of ADMB are flexibility, speed, precision, stability and built-in methods to quantify uncertainty. {\textcopyright} 2012 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {In the context of applying the precautionary approach to fisheries management, much of the current attention on developing reference points has been focussed on finfish species. However, at present the largest marine fisheries in Canada in terms of landings and value are those for invertebrate species. A workshop on reference points for invertebrate fisheries was held in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, from 2 to 5 December 2002 to address the particular needs of fisheries on this diverse group of species. Seven of the papers presented at that workshop were published as a group in this issue of the Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Science. Reproduction and recruitment were identified by all of these papers as key elements of population resilience and productivity that needed to be monitored in some way. The monitoring of reproductive capacity should be extended to aspects important in the mating systems, such as local densities, spatial patterns of age-size structure, and spatial and temporal patterns of breeding areas for broadcast spawners with poorly mobile or sessile adults. Similarly, such monitoring would also include female and male size and the number of female reproductive opportunities for crustacean species with copulating adults.},

abstract = {In this paper, we concentrate on spatial aspects of growth and reproduction for sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) to advance the general theory for development of reference points for sessile animals and to illustrate the general points with several specific examples. Nonlinear mixed effects models can be used to define the spatial distribution of growth rates and their implications for the definition of growth overfishing. We develop a basin model to illustrate that the typical "boom and bust" effects, often attributed to environmental factors, are explained equally well by spatial variations in habitat quality, spatial concentration of fisheries, and dispersal of larvae among areas. Results suggest that incentives to concentrate fishing effort in lower productivity areas may be an effective tool for reducing recruitment variation and improving yields. Reductions in fishing mortality might be possible with closed areas as they can be used to reduce the concentration of effort on high scallop densities. Further, rotational area management strategies can offer the promise of balancing demands for increased yield, prevention of recruitment overfishing, maintaining spawning reserves, and reducing habitat damage and bycatch.},

Today, it remains popular for its clarity, richness of content and direct relevance to agricultural, biological, health, engineering, and other applications. The authors focus on examining the way a response variable depends on a combination of explanatory variables, treatment, and classification variables. They give particular emphasis to the important case where the dependence occurs through some unknown, linear combination of the explanatory variables. The Second Edition includes topics added to the core of the first edition, including conditional and marginal likelihood methods, estimating equations, and models for dispersion effects and components of dispersion. The discussion of other topics-log-linear and related models, log odds-ratio regression models, multinomial response models, inverse linear and related models, quasi-likelihood functions, and model checking-was expanded and incorporates significant revisions. Comprehension of the material requires simply a knowledge of matrix theory and the basic ideas of probability theory, but for the most part, the book is self-contained. Therefore, with its worked examples, plentiful exercises, and topics of direct use to researchers in many disciplines, Generalized Linear Models serves as ideal text, self-study guide, and reference.},

It aims to facilitate the development and implementation of indicators and to serve as a basis for the development of part of the series of Technical Guidelines in Support of the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. The paper reviews the concept of sustainable development ('sustainability'). Five sustainability frameworks are suggested for developing and grouping indicators. A discussion of the criteria that could be used to measure and monitor progress towards sustainability includes the types of possible indicators, their use within the sustainability concept, use of reference points on which to compare indicators and their relation to planning and management. Sustainable Development Reference Systems are introduced as a tool for grouping indicators and representing the interrelationships among them. Visual methods of portraying the human and environmental dimensions of sustainability and their indicators can be broadened to permit temporal and spatial comparisons. These, combined with systems to scale the different dimensions to reflect different societal values of their importance, can assist policy makers, fisheries managers, industries, non-governmental organizations and the general public in understanding and assessing progress towards sustainable development of capture fisheries.},

abstract = {Large-scale changes in American lobster (Homarus americanus) landings and abundance have been documented in both Canada and the United States over the last several decades. The spatial coherence of these changes suggests the importance of common environmental and fishery-related factors operating over broad areas in the western North Atlantic. Changes in both biotic and abiotic factors have been hypothesized to underlie the recent increases in lobster production. Area expansion of lobsters to previously unoccupied or low-density areas appears to be an important element of the population increase. Here, we review biological reference points applied to American lobster populations in the United States and Canada. Egg production per recruit models have been used to specify limit reference points (F10{\%} in the United States) or target reference points (increasing egg production per recruit to twice its 1995 level in Canada). Surplus production and yield-per-recruit models have also been employed to provide qualitative management guidelines. We describe sources of uncertainty in the development of biological reference points for American lobster based on dynamic pool models in relation to the precautionary approach. Finally we consider auxiliary indicators and reference points with potential application to lobster stocks.},

abstract = {Unanticipated declines among exploited species have commonly occurred despite harvests that appeared sustainable prior to collapse. This is particularly true in the oceans where spatial scales of management are often mismatched with spatially complex metapopulations. We explore causes, consequences, and potential solutions for spatial mismatches in harvested metapopulations in three ways. First, we generate novel theory illustrating when and how harvesting metapopulations increases spatial variability and in turn masks local-scale volatility. Second, we illustrate why spatial variability in harvested metapopulations leads to negative consequences using an empirical example of a Pacific herring metapopulation. Finally, we construct a numerical management strategy evaluation model to identify and highlight potential solutions for mismatches in spatial scale and spatial variability. Our results highlight that spatial complexity can promote stability at large scales, however, ignoring spatial complexity produces cryptic and negative consequences for people and animals that interact with resources at small scales. Harvesting metapopulations magnifies spatial variability, which creates discrepancies between regional and local trends while increasing risk of local population collapses. Such effects asymmetrically impact locally constrained fishers and predators, which are more exposed to risks of localized collapses. Importantly, we show that dynamically optimizing harvest can minimize local risk without sacrificing yield. Thus, multiple nested scales of management may be necessary to avoid cryptic collapses in metapopulations and the ensuing ecological, social, and economic consequences.},

The fishery took off in the late 1980s as a result of expanding export markets, but has experienced substantial decline in landings since 1992 because of large decreases in urchin stock abundance. Fishery-independent surveys have not been conducted, and no formal stock assessment has been done prior to this study. Using the data collected from the fishery and urchin life history parameters derived from scientific studies, we conducted a formal stock assessment for the urchin stock. A stochastic observation-error length-structured model is used to describe the dynamics of the sea urchin population. A robust Bayesian approach is used for estimating fishery parameters because of concerns of possible outliers in fisheries data and mis-specification of priors. This study shows that the current stock is only 10{\%} of the virgin stock biomass and that the exploitation rate is close to 40{\%} suggesting that a large reduction in exploitation rate is necessary. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Complexity is increasingly the hallmark in environmental management practices of sandy shorelines. This arises primarily from meeting growing public demands (e.g., real estate, recreation) whilst reconciling economic demands with expectations of coastal users who have modern conservation ethics. Ideally, shoreline management is underpinned by empirical data, but selecting ecologically-meaningful metrics to accurately measure the condition of systems, and the ecological effects of human activities, is a complex task. Here we construct a framework for metric selection, considering six categories of issues that authorities commonly address: erosion; habitat loss; recreation; fishing; pollution (litter and chemical contaminants); and wildlife conservation. Possible metrics were scored in terms of their ability to reflect environmental change, and against criteria that are widely used for judging the performance of ecological indicators (i.e., sensitivity, practicability, costs, and public appeal). From this analysis, four types of broadly applicable metrics that also performed very well against the indicator criteria emerged: 1.) traits of bird populations and assemblages (e.g., abundance, diversity, distributions, habitat use); 2.) breeding/reproductive performance sensu lato (especially relevant for birds and turtles nesting on beaches and in dunes, but equally applicable to invertebrates and plants); 3.) population parameters and distributions of vertebrates associated primarily with dunes and the supralittoral beach zone (traditionally focused on birds and turtles, but expandable to mammals); 4.) compound measurements of the abundance/cover/biomass of biota (plants, invertebrates, vertebrates) at both the population and assemblage level. Local constraints (i.e., the absence of birds in highly degraded urban settings or lack of dunes on bluff-backed beaches) and particular issues may require alternatives. Metrics - if selected and applied correctly - provide empirical evidence of environmental condition and change, but often do not reflect deeper environmental values per se. Yet, values remain poorly articulated for many beach systems; this calls for a comprehensive identification of environmental values and the development of targeted programs to conserve these values on sandy shorelines globally. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Defeo2009,
abstract = {We provide a brief synopsis of the unique physical and ecological attributes of sandy beach ecosystems and review the main anthropogenic pressures acting on the world's single largest type of open shoreline. Threats to beaches arise from a range of stressors which span a spectrum of impact scales from localised effects (e.g. trampling) to a truly global reach (e.g. sea-level rise). These pressures act at multiple temporal and spatial scales, translating into ecological impacts that are manifested across several dimensions in time and space so that today almost every beach on every coastline is threatened by human activities. Press disturbances (whatever the impact source involved) are becoming increasingly common, operating on time scales of years to decades. However, long-term data sets that describe either the natural dynamics of beach systems or the human impacts on beaches are scarce and fragmentary. A top priority is to implement long-term field experiments and monitoring programmes that quantify the dynamics of key ecological attributes on sandy beaches. Because of the inertia associated with global climate change and human population growth, no realistic management scenario will alleviate these threats in the short term. The immediate priority is to avoid further development of coastal areas likely to be directly impacted by retreating shorelines. There is also scope for improvement in experimental design to better distinguish natural variability from anthropogenic impacts. Sea-level rise and other effects of global warming are expected to intensify other anthropogenic pressures, and could cause unprecedented ecological impacts. The definition of the relevant scales of analysis, which will vary according to the magnitude of the impact and the organisational level under analysis, and the recognition of a physical-biological coupling at different scales, should be included in approaches to quantify impacts. Zoning strategies and marine reserves, which have not been widely implemented in sandy beaches, could be a key tool for biodiversity conservation and should also facilitate spillover effects into adjacent beach habitats. Setback and zoning strategies need to be enforced through legislation, and all relevant stakeholders should be included in the design, implementation and institutionalisation of these initiatives. New perspectives for rational management of sandy beaches require paradigm shifts, by including not only basic ecosystem principles, but also incentives for effective governance and sharing of management roles between government and local stakeholders. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Background: The striped venus clam Chamelea gallina is an economically important species in Adriatic Sea fisheries. The use of hydraulic dredging for its catch has a long history in Italy and its management faced several stages of development in the last 40 years. A great effort has been made in the past two decades to move from poorly or weakly managed fisheries to a well-structured co-management system to improve the sustainability of this fishery. However, a prerequisite for appropriate resource management is a sound knowledge of the biology and reproductive strategy of the species. Results: We investigated three major biological features– the gametogenic cycle, size at sexual maturity and partial fecundity – by microscopic, histological and video analysis techniques. We demonstrated that its breeding season is driven by rises in seawater temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration and that its spawning period lasted from March to September. Size at sexual maturity was reached very early in the life cycle. As regards partial fecundity – the number of mature oocytes potentially released by females with ripe gonads in a single release event – varied in relation to size. Nevertheless, the reduction on the Minimum Conservation Reference Size (MCRS) from 25 to 22 mm (Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/2237) lead to a 40{\%} reduction in the number of emitted eggs. Conclusions: We suggest that the ability of Adriatic clam stocks to withstand the strong fishing pressure of the past 40 years and the present one is due to their high reproductive potential and multiple spawning events combined with the effect of management measures (closed areas/seasons, quota, MCRS) and technical constraints on the gear and the sieve on board. Moreover, since the reduced MCRS for Venus shells is still larger than the size at maturity, it will probably not be detrimental to the reproductive capacity of the stock.},

Three aging techniques, thin sections and acetate peel replicas – which involve shell sectioning – and surface growth rings were used to estimate the age and growth of Chamelea gallina populations in the mid-western Adriatic Sea. Their results were compared to identify the most reliable and least time-consuming approach. There were no significant differences between the two shell sectioning techniques ($\chi$2 = 4.66, df = 3, p = 0.198), which were described by the same von Bertalanffy (VBF) growth curve parameters (L8 = 43.9, k = 0.26, t0 = −0.84), whereas significantly different L8 and k values were found between the two shell sectioning techniques and surface growth rings (L8: $\chi$2 = 13.62, df = 1, p {\textless} 0.001; k: $\chi$2 = 9.18, df = 1, p {\textless} 0.002; these statistics refer to the comparison between acetate peels and surface growth rings). The latter approach proved unreliable and error-prone, as it underestimated age and overestimated the growth rate (L8 = 26.4, k = 1.91, t0 = −0.11). Although the thin sections and acetate peel techniques both provide reliable age and growth estimates, the former approach was less time-consuming. Our analyses demonstrated that shell growth is slower in the cold season and in older specimens and that it has slowed down over the past few decades.},

The objective of this study was to compare macrofauna communities on six beaches on the Gulf of C{\'{a}}diz coast, which were classified according to the anthropic alterations they support, and evaluate the influence of abiotic factors on the species distribution. Sampling was done in the infralittoral-sublittoral zone of each beach using a modified manual dredge. Five perpendicular transects of 25 m, each separated by 10 m, were performed per beach, with a total sample area of 43.75 m2 per beach. A total of 27 species were found, of which Donax trunculus, Diogenes pugilator, and Tritia grana were the most abundant. Anthropogenic effects are appreciable in the infralittoral-sublittoral although they are areas that are permanently submerged and less exposed than the intertidal. Beach nourishments carried out with large volumes of sand can alter the grain size, the most influential parameter on the distribution of the species, and consequently, affect the macrofauna community that inhabits these beaches.},

abstract = {Stock status for many medium- and small-scale fisheries is unknown due, for example, to a lack of catch data and the absence of scientific observer programs. However, length-frequency data are often available for such fisheries because they are the cheapest and easiest data to obtain. Various stock assessment methods have been developed that use length-frequency data and make equilibrium assumptions regarding both recruitment and fishing mortality. These assumptions raise questions regarding the reliability of the results, particularly when the method is applied to a single sample of length-frequency. We developed a Length-Based Pseudo-cohort Analysis (LBPA) model whose parameters can be estimated using multiple length frequencies and penalized maximum likelihood, under the assumption that using more than one length-frequency sample reduces the effects of the equilibrium conditions assumed in the model. We explored the performance of LBPA using simulations that examined the implications for estimation of the spawning potential rate (SPR) and the relative fishing mortality (F/FMSY). These simulations considered scenarios related to exploitation rate, steepness, numbers of years and sample sizes for length-frequency, and data weights. The performance of LBPA was compared to that of length-based spawning potential ratio (LBSPR). LBPA performed better with additional length-frequencies than with increased sample size, irrespective of how the data were weighted, and generally outperformed LBSPR. Estimates were more accurate and less biased when exploitation rates were high. This work provides guidelines that should be considered when using length-based pseudo-cohort models for data-poor fisheries.},

abstract = {Understanding the spatial structure of fishing resource stocks is a fundamental aspect for the management and development of sustainable and productive fisheries. However, this aspect is usually simplified under the assumption of a stock unit, which assumes biologically similar and spatially homogeneous individuals, regardless of the real ranges and characteristics of their distribution. The persistence of geographic patterns in the biological traits of species suggests the spatial structuring of a population, a highly relevant aspect in stock assessment, calculation of Biological Reference Points (BRP), and management of fishing resources. In this work, the spatial heterogeneity of the biological traits of common hake (Merluccius gayi) from off-central Chile is modeled. Considering four reference zones, biological data collected over 26 years of monitoring fisheries and acoustic surveys is analyzed. The findings allow to biologically differentiate these areas whose main characteristics are the increase from north to south in the condition factor, gonad weight, and size at maturity. The Spawning Potential Ratio (SPR), fishing mortality, and BRP are calculated. Exploratorily, if these areas were considered closed subpopulations, results show that overexploitation is not a characteristic of all hake fishing areas, and that not considering the heterogeneity of biological traits causes the overestimation of the population condition in the main fishing areas. The aim of this research was to understand the spatial structuring of common hake based on the heterogeneity of biological attributes and its impact for fisheries management purposes.},

abstract = {Generalized depletion models are useful for representing catch dynamics when biological compositional data are lacking but high frequency records of catch and effort are available. A shortcoming of these models is that although they estimate vulnerable abundance they do not provide direct information on the productivity of the stocks. Here we combine generalized depletion models with a biomass dynamic model of the Pella-Tomlinson type. The inference framework is hierarchical, with initial biomass estimates from generalized depletion models being used as input to the biomass dynamic model to estimate its hyper-parameters. Two hierarchical inference approaches are employed: the standard state-space framework and a new hybrid marginal-estimated approximation to the likelihood function, which make different simplifying assumptions. We apply this assessment approach to the first Chilean fishery with a Management Plan, the southern sea urchin fishery. Results from both hierarchical inference methods show a stock fluctuating between high and low biomass levels, for which maximum sustainable yield appears as a risk-prone annual harvest policy. Given this we propose an alternative annual harvest rate corresponding to the average latent productivity over the years of peaks and troughs of biomass fluctuations.},

The fishery took off in the late 1980s as a result of expanding export markets, but has experienced substantial decline in landings since 1992 because of large decreases in urchin stock abundance. Fishery-independent surveys have not been conducted, and no formal stock assessment has been done prior to this study. Using the data collected from the fishery and urchin life history parameters derived from scientific studies, we conducted a formal stock assessment for the urchin stock. A stochastic observation-error length-structured model is used to describe the dynamics of the sea urchin population. A robust Bayesian approach is used for estimating fishery parameters because of concerns of possible outliers in fisheries data and mis-specification of priors. This study shows that the current stock is only 10{\%} of the virgin stock biomass and that the exploitation rate is close to 40{\%} suggesting that a large reduction in exploitation rate is necessary. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Unanticipated declines among exploited species have commonly occurred despite harvests that appeared sustainable prior to collapse. This is particularly true in the oceans where spatial scales of management are often mismatched with spatially complex metapopulations. We explore causes, consequences, and potential solutions for spatial mismatches in harvested metapopulations in three ways. First, we generate novel theory illustrating when and how harvesting metapopulations increases spatial variability and in turn masks local-scale volatility. Second, we illustrate why spatial variability in harvested metapopulations leads to negative consequences using an empirical example of a Pacific herring metapopulation. Finally, we construct a numerical management strategy evaluation model to identify and highlight potential solutions for mismatches in spatial scale and spatial variability. Our results highlight that spatial complexity can promote stability at large scales, however, ignoring spatial complexity produces cryptic and negative consequences for people and animals that interact with resources at small scales. Harvesting metapopulations magnifies spatial variability, which creates discrepancies between regional and local trends while increasing risk of local population collapses. Such effects asymmetrically impact locally constrained fishers and predators, which are more exposed to risks of localized collapses. Importantly, we show that dynamically optimizing harvest can minimize local risk without sacrificing yield. Thus, multiple nested scales of management may be necessary to avoid cryptic collapses in metapopulations and the ensuing ecological, social, and economic consequences.},

Nonlinear mixed effects models can be used to define the spatial distribution of growth rates and their implications for the definition of growth overfishing. We develop a basin model to illustrate that the typical "boom and bust" effects, often attributed to environmental factors, are explained equally well by spatial variations in habitat quality, spatial concentration of fisheries, and dispersal of larvae among areas. Results suggest that incentives to concentrate fishing effort in lower productivity areas may be an effective tool for reducing recruitment variation and improving yields. Reductions in fishing mortality might be possible with closed areas as they can be used to reduce the concentration of effort on high scallop densities. Further, rotational area management strategies can offer the promise of balancing demands for increased yield, prevention of recruitment overfishing, maintaining spawning reserves, and reducing habitat damage and bycatch.},

A workshop on reference points for invertebrate fisheries was held in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, from 2 to 5 December 2002 to address the particular needs of fisheries on this diverse group of species. Seven of the papers presented at that workshop were published as a group in this issue of the Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Science. Reproduction and recruitment were identified by all of these papers as key elements of population resilience and productivity that needed to be monitored in some way. The monitoring of reproductive capacity should be extended to aspects important in the mating systems, such as local densities, spatial patterns of age-size structure, and spatial and temporal patterns of breeding areas for broadcast spawners with poorly mobile or sessile adults. Similarly, such monitoring would also include female and male size and the number of female reproductive opportunities for crustacean species with copulating adults.},

A surplus-production model was run using ASPIC and used to assess the temporal variation in the levels of fishing for this bivalve throughout the study period (2002-2015), as well as to suggest conservation reference points that could guarantee the sustainable exploitation of this resource. During the study period, the maximum C. chione catch was registered in 2003 (306 t) and the minimum in 2006 (93 t). The ASPIC model for C. chione stock suggests that a Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) of 216 t could be produced from a total stock biomass of 983 t (Bmsy) at a fishing mortality rate of total biomass of 0.22 (Fmsy), with B/ Bmsy and F/Fmsy values of 1.34 and 0.82, respectively, indicating that the stock is approaching good status.},

abstract = {Mapping the distribution of marine species plays a particularly important role in resource management. Prospecting campaigns were carried out between 2015 and 2017 along the FnideqTamernout area of the occidental Moroccan Mediterranean Sea, through artisanal boats equipped with hydraulic dredges for shellfish fishing. A total of 1526 samples of Callista chione were measured and weighed to estimate and thematically map the density of this species. The population structure, the length-weight relationship and the stock status were studied in total area. Results show that there was a significant difference of size structure distribution of the studied subareas. Mean length of all subareas was 69.15±1.13 mm with a minimum of 24.17 mm and a maximum of 105 mm. The large majority of the individuals (93{\%}) sampled presented the exploitable fraction of the stock. Length-weight relationship revealed a negative allometry for all subareas indicating that length grows faster than weight, except that of Amsa with positive allometry. Total biomass of C. chione records 17 million individuals for 1636 tons distributed over 8 subareas of homogeneous concentrations of different densities. Martil and M'diq present the most productive subareas with 78{\%} of total stock. These findings can be used to put rigorous and rational rules for fishing and stock management of this species so as to ensure the preservation of the C. chione resource and the sustainability of the socio-economic activity it generates in the region.},

abstract = {Large-scale changes in American lobster (Homarus americanus) landings and abundance have been documented in both Canada and the United States over the last several decades. The spatial coherence of these changes suggests the importance of common environmental and fishery-related factors operating over broad areas in the western North Atlantic. Changes in both biotic and abiotic factors have been hypothesized to underlie the recent increases in lobster production. Area expansion of lobsters to previously unoccupied or low-density areas appears to be an important element of the population increase. Here, we review biological reference points applied to American lobster populations in the United States and Canada. Egg production per recruit models have been used to specify limit reference points (F10{\%} in the United States) or target reference points (increasing egg production per recruit to twice its 1995 level in Canada). Surplus production and yield-per-recruit models have also been employed to provide qualitative management guidelines. We describe sources of uncertainty in the development of biological reference points for American lobster based on dynamic pool models in relation to the precautionary approach. Finally we consider auxiliary indicators and reference points with potential application to lobster stocks.},

The ratio of the fished to unfished magnitude of P is the spawning potential ratio (SPA) and is a measure of the impact of fishing on the potential productivity of a stock. Currenluse of SPR merges concepts developed to quantify the compensation required for population persistence given anthropogenic increases in mortality with observations of stock productivity and SSBR for fisheries in the Western North Atlantic. It has a firm theoretical basis and is evaluated against yield per recruit and contrasted with pther traditional biological reference points. SPR is widely used in U.S. fisheries managed under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, usually in the context of a percentage of the unflShed SSBR. lis implementation is intended to be risk-aversive through selection of minimum acceptable levels above which stocks maintain acceptable productivity. The behavior of the underlying principles suggests SPR values below about 0.2 should be avoided unless thare is evidence for exceptionally strong density-dependence in the stock. Critical levels have typically been set in the range of 0.2 to 0.3 primarily based upon the experience in the northwest Atlantic.},

abstract = {Throughout the world's major commercial fisheries the standard paradigm includes fitting a stock assessment model to the data and then applying some form of reference point or a range of reference points, usually a target exploitation rate, to calculate a point estimate of the annual allowable catch. Over the last decade the methods available to be used in these models have changed dramatically from those using only catch, catch-at-age and survey or CPUE data to methods that now use every source of data available in a totally integrated framework. The use of meta-analysis has provided formal statistical methods for incorporating information learned from other stocks. Modern methods make it possible to express uncertainty in all model outputs, but management agencies are only now learning to deal with explicit recognition of uncertainty and have lagged far behind the scientific capability to express uncertainty. While modern stock assessment models have grown increasingly complex and their development is limited to a priesthood of experts, I believe the future trend will be to base management decisions on simple rules that are more often data-based rather than model-based, while the complex models will serve primarily to evaluate the robustness of these decision rules.},

abstract = {The United States and many other countries have developed sets of standard reference points that can be used to determine allowable harvests. Here I explore some of the problems that have arisen in this practice, including (1) uncertainties in current stock biomass and virgin stock biomass as applied in reference point formula, (2) the inappropriateness of reference points applied to species for which they were not derived, (3) the tendency of reference-point use to produce an environment in which stock-assessment scientists rarely evaluate alternative management policies, and (4) the role of concern about reference points as a displacement activity for scientists that keeps them from working on more significant problems in fisheries management. I suggest that alternative, data-based, rather than model-based, approaches to setting quotas should be preferred. I consider the true meaning of the precautionary approach and the trend toward neglect of the purpose of a fishery - to produce social and economic benefits to society; it is those benefits that need protection. Finally, I suggest that the key to successful fisheries management is not better science, better reference points, or more precautionary approaches but rather implementing systems of marine governance that provide incentives for individual fishermen, scientists, and managers to make decisions in their own interest that contribute to societal goals.},

Among other things, the findings in the Spanish case show a complex relationship between the amount of fish landed and price; a clear substitution relationship between fresh fish and aquaculture; a negative impact oflabour costs in amanual labour-inten- sive sector such as fishing, which in developed countries is being affected by an exodus of manpower to other sectors where there is less uncertainty surrounding labour conditions; the impact ofSpain being barred from international fishing grounds a result ofthe delimitation of exclusive economic zones (EEZs); and the dwindling importance of fisheries traffic as a result of the port devolution process begun in Spain in the early 1990s.

abstract = {Integrated analysis has increasingly been the preferred approach for conducting stock assessments and providing the basis for management advice for fish and invertebrate stocks around the world. Many decisions are required when developing integrated stock assessments. For example, the analyst needs to decide whether the model fits the data, if the optimization was successful, if estimates are consistent retrospectively, and if the model is suitable to predict future stock responses to fishing. This study provides practical guidelines for implementing selected diagnostic tools that can assist analysts in identifying problems with model specifications and alternatives that can be explored to minimize or eliminate such problems. Emphasis is placed on reviewing the implementation and interpretation of contemporary model diagnostic tools. We first describe each diagnostic approach and its utility. We then proceed by providing a “cookbook recipe” on how to implement each of the diagnostics, together with an interpretation of the results, using two worked examples of integrated stock assessments with Stock Synthesis. Further, we provide a conceptual flow chart that lays out a generic process of model development and selection using the presented model diagnostics. Based on this, we propose the following four properties as objective criteria for evaluating the plausibility of a model: (1) model convergence, (2) fit to the data, (3) model consistency, and (4) prediction skill. It would greatly benefit the stock assessment community if the next generation of stock assessment models could include the diagnostic tests presented in this study as a set of open source tools.},

abstract = {Management strategy evaluation (MSE) involves using simulation to compare the relative effectiveness for achieving management objectives of different combinations of data collection schemes, methods of analysis and subsequent processes leading to management actions. MSE can be used to identify a ‘best' management strategy among a set of candidate strategies, or to determine how well an existing strategy performs. The ability of MSE to facilitate fisheries management achieving its aims depends on how well uncertainty is represented, and how effectively the results of simulations are summarized and presented to the decision-makers. Key challenges for effective use of MSE therefore include characterizing objectives and uncertainty, assigning plausibility ranks to the trials considered, and working with decision- makers to interpret and implement the results of the MSE. This paper explores how MSEs are conducted and characterizes current ‘best practice' guidelines, while also indicating whether and how these best practices were applied to two case- studies: the Bering–Chukchi–Beaufort Seas bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae) and the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax caerulea; Clupeidae).},

This review together with recent morphological data from macro- tidal beaches on the central Queensland coast are combined to provide an overview, and to iden- tify three types of macro-tidal beaches. Two are true beaches. Higher waves, and particularly swell produces moderate gradient (1-3'), concave, planar beaches dominated by incident, though infragravity wave energy. Moderate waves and sea conditions tend to produce lower gradient (0.5{\%}), multi-bar (ridge and runnel) topography also attributable to infragavity standing waves. As wave energy drops still further a third type results with a high tide beach fronting tide- dominated tidal flats. This latter is not a true beach but rather a transition from beach to tidal flat.},

Here, we expand the list of shallow-marine bivalves known to be exploited worldwide, with 720 exploited bivalve species added beyond the 81 in the United Nations FAO Production Database, and investigate their diversity, distribution and extinction vulnerability using a metric based on ecological traits and evolutionary history. The added species shift the richness hotspot of exploited species from the northeast Atlantic to the west Pacific, with 55{\%} of bivalve families being exploited, concentrated mostly in two major clades but all major body plans. We find that exploited species tend to be larger in size, occur in shallower waters, and have larger geographic and thermal ranges—the last two traits are known to confer extinction-resistance in marine bivalves. However, exploited bivalve species in certain regions such as the tropical east Atlantic and the temperate northeast and southeast Pacific, are among those with high intrinsic vulnerability and are a large fraction of regional faunal diversity. Our results pinpoint regional faunas and specific taxa of likely concern for management and conservation.},

abstract = {Three alternative forms of the spawner-recruit relationship – the Beverton-Holt and two expressions of the Ricker function - and a fourth form representing annual recruitment deviations without an explicit relationship to spawning biomass, were applied in an integrated assessment model for Antarctic krill. Model data were from the international krill fishery and U.S. AMLR surveys in the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) Subarea 48.1, the area around the Antarctic peninsula where the majority of recent fishing for krill has taken place. Sensitivity tests using pre-specified values for the standard deviation of the logarithm of annual recruitment residuals ($\sigma$R) and productivity (steepness, h) for the relationship between spawning biomass and subsequent recruitment indicated that neither the Beverton-Holt nor Ricker functions were superior to configurations of the model that did not assume a spawner-recruit relationship. As the predictive power of the spawner-recruit functions was reduced by increasing the value of $\sigma$R the fit to the data improved. All the functions fitted the data best when $\sigma$R was large enough so that random recruitment with respect to spawning biomass was produced. The alternative functions produced the same time series of recruitment and spawning biomass estimates when they were determined by the data rather than forced towards an assumed relationship. Although the Beverton-Holt and Ricker models were poor predictors of the data, cross-correlations of the recruitment predictions with the spawning biomass predictions from the best models indicated that recruitment was statistically correlated with spawning biomasses in the previous two to four years. The highest correlation (0.58) was with spawning biomass three years previously. Correlations in the reverse direction, with spawning biomass following recruitment were insignificant. These results suggest that recruitment variability does not influence subsequent spawning biomass in krill. They leave open the possibility that krill spawning biomass could influence subsequent recruitment, but not as modeled in the Beverton-Holt or Ricker functions with a one-year lag and the pre-specified von Bertalanffy growth.},
