abstract = {Stock synthesis (SS) is a statistical age-structured population modeling framework that has been applied in a wide variety of fish assessments globally. The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Many criteria for statistical parameter estimation, such as maximum likelihood, are formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem. Automatic Differentiation Model Builder (ADMB) is a programming framework based on automatic differentiation, aimed at highly nonlinear models with a large number of parameters. The benefits of using AD are computational efficiency and high numerical accuracy, both crucial in many practical problems. We describe the basic components and the underlying philosophy of ADMB, with an emphasis on functionality found in no other statistical software. One example of such a feature is the generic implementation of Laplace approximation of high-dimensional integrals for use in latent variable models. We also review the literature in which ADMB has been used, and discuss future development of ADMB as an open source project. Overall, the main advantages of ADMB are flexibility, speed, precision, stability and built-in methods to quantify uncertainty. {\textcopyright} 2012 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {A modern perspective on mixed models The availability of powerful computing methods in recent decades has thrust linear and nonlinear mixed models into the mainstream of statistical application. This volume offers a modern perspective on generalized, linear, and mixed models, presenting a unified and accessible treatment of the newest statistical methods for analyzing correlated, nonnormally distributed data. As a follow-up to Searle's classic, Linear Models, and Variance Components by Searle, Casella, and McCulloch, this new work progresses from the basic one-way classification to generalized linear mixed models. A variety of statistical methods are explained and illustrated, with an emphasis on maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood. An invaluable resource for applied statisticians and industrial practitioners, as well as students interested in the latest results, Generalized, Linear, and Mixed Models features: A review of the basics of linear models and linear mixed models Descriptions of models for nonnormal data, including generalized linear and nonlinear models Analysis and illustration of techniques for a variety of real data sets Information on the accommodation of longitudinal data using these models Coverage of the prediction of realized values of random effects A discussion of the impact of computing issues on mixed models},
